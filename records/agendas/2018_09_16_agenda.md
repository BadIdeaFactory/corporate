---------------


1) Accounting Adventures: IT IS SO GOOD!  Also, everybody will be given a read-only account so they can make sure we aren't embezzling all the funds.
2) $7k project I'd love to be approved!  (just me doing work, normally I wouldn't run this through BIFFUD but it would be a good strategic relationship)
3) Brand Updates
4) I would like us to consider adding some "teeth" to our projects we approve, now that we have money coming in, and suggest that going forward we only approve projects that we are willing to allocate $300 towards supporting.  This might help us prevent having a bunch of dead projects!
5) There are a slew of bylaws changes I'm going to be proposing for the *next* plotting session.  Just wanted to give a heads up about them.  Most are real, so we need to be sure to balance them with a bunch of bullshit too.
6) Budget approval for the accounting software ($25 / month for the rest of the year.)
7) Budget Debate: EmojiOne 4.0 for $150 (they won't give us any more off, though I will still ask!)

Related to #7, turns out we allocated $500 to the Emoji Compass (wtf were we smoking holy shit that is so much money) not $300
in theory Matt could consider using the $200 he found in the couch for the emoji licenses, but I think he was going to try to get a sense from the room
cc @knowtheory
I will make the formal project request
the budget request is already there -- and the emojione budget is already allocated technically, so more just a discussion on if that's actually a thing (edited)
