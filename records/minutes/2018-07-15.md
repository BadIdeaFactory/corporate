## New Business
	- What do we expect grants to contribute back to the Bad Idea Factory?
		- Anthony:  Private equity does 2% management fee and 20% on returns over a certain amount (for private equity that's basically what a project earns)

		- What are you willing to contribute for the Bad Idea Factory and what are you expecting in return?
		- What is the income side to the grant?
