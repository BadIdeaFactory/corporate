#### Oppositions Response by Undermind (Ted Han):
	- It's mostly excellent.  We're done with the irrational exuberant phase and have moved onto just the irrational phase.

## Committee Reports

Note: Present committees were willed into existence by the Overmind 2 hours prior to meeting.

### Corporate Letterhead Committee (Matt Stempeck)
	- Showed us an amazing proposed letterhead
	- Proposed letterhead covered our core values.
		- Sheep watermark
		- "Priveleged" instead of "Privileged"
		- Macro will be installed so that the logo rotates depending on the time of day.
				- Since logo is already off kilter this cannot be used to tell time or anything else that could be useful.

### Tronc Committee
	- Main blocker has been solved since we now have a corporate letterhead.

### Robert's Rules of Order Committee
	- Members were informed committee now existed.
	- Plan to get copy of Robert's Rules of Order and read it.

### Legal Entity Committee
	- Our emails were landing in the spam folder of our lawyer.
	- Lawyer had many questions of us:
			- One big question: Are ownership % change regularly?
	- We get a certificate of ownership!  Yay!

---

## Project Updates

### Glorious ContextuBot
	Report given by Dan and Matt
	- Laurian (gridinoc): considering unionizing but most likely will not since socialism freaks him out.
	- They're kicking ass.
	- Dan thinks it is going well but Matt doesn't think it is.
		- Some snags due to python (lack of knowledge/experience by Laurian)
		- User testing in a month
		- Comic book format of the viral video
		- What video gets submitted to Reddit (University of Iowa, Poliinformatics), etc.
			- Why did we pick comic books?
				- We can't resist comics...
				- Time transcript so speech bubbles at the right time

### Truth Goggles
	Report given by Dan
	- Moving along slowly
	- Funding comes in on January 1st 2018
	- No major progress since we don't have funding.

### ScriptChat
	Report given by Lou
	- Anybody into javascript should check it out because it's awesome
	- Source of data/chat history/etc.
	- Lou if you want to help out, just reach out me.  Chat on Slack or hangout or whatever.
	- Slack channel will be created

### Overengineered Diplomacy
	Report given by Lou
	- Not much to update on
	- Waiting January to find out status of map rendering engine
	- Demoed map:  From actual GIS data.  Boundaries are from the 1920's, etc.
