SECTION 0: The Organization
---------------------------------------------------------------------

**What is BIFFUD?**

BIFFUD is a collective of chaotic creatives using technology to
make people thinking face emoji.  We build things and incorporate humor
into the process as best we can.  Many of the projects we pursue are
explicitly bad ideas, but the point is that we implement them expertly.

**What is the business model?**

Fun, not money, is the goal here.  Some of the projects we make may end
up having an opportunity to earn some cash, but that's likely to be up
to their creators and is by no means an expectation or requirement.

**But wait, is this real?**

Yep!  We are a registered LLC in Pennsylvania.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1: Partnership
---------------------------------------------------------------------

**What does it mean to be a partner at BIFFUD**

Bad Idea Factory is a Limited Liability Corporation, which means that
partnership can't just be about the spirit or the lulz -- partners
have legal responsibilities, ownership, and control over the company
direction.

Partners will be expected to:

1. Make a capital contribution upon joining.
2. Participate and vote in monthly partner meetings.
3. Participate and vote on corporate Github.
4. Contribute some poetry on corporate Github.
5. Stay involved and aware of the projects being undertaken by members.
6. Help maintain and further the BIFFUD public footprint.
7. Try to attend any BIFFUD events.

OTHER IDEAS: -- partners could be asked to make a regular capital contribution.

In return, partners should expect:

1. To be part of something potentially awesome and fun
2. To have their votes and company choices codified forever
3. See almost no return on investment aside from joy
4. But also if money is earned, they'll probably see some of it
5. Especially if they helped make the project that is earning $$
6. If we find a path to sustainability, they can help decide how
resources are spent


**Are there different levels of partnership?**

Some people are likely to want to be involved as a fan.  There is room
for that!  But for the health of the company our partners / owners need
to be more tangibly and actively invested.

Anybody with a passion around an idea that fits our mission (as determined
by the partners) can contribute to BIFFUD projects.

How's this for a possible breakdown:

- *Partner:* A legal owner of the LLC, makes a capital contribution and
will see a tax form at the end of the year.
- *Member:* Supports BIFFUD either through code or light activity.
- *Fan:* Follows us on twitter or something.


**How do we add new partners / how does a partner leave the organization?**

JOINING IDEAS:
- Partners vote, majority vote allows someone to become a partner; they
need to make a capital contribution to cover their legal costs as well as
their share of the next two year's overhead costs (accounting, legal)

LEAVING IDEAS:
- If a partner chooses to leave, they're allowed to just leave; they won't
be entitled to any group profits (lol) made after the point of their departure
but would still be fully entitled to any payments due to them for projects
they helped build.


**What is the capital contribution required to join?**

We need to have enough funding to pay the basic bills for a few years, and
the partners are going to be the source of that money.  Proper funding is
important because it allows partners to clearly separate personal finances
from corporate finances.

Here are expenses we will need to cover:

1. Legal fees ($600 for the initial registration)
2. Taxes (~$500 per year) -- need to confirm with an accountant
3. Other required expenses (??) -- need to check with the lawyer (legal fees)
4. Contingency fund ($500) -- seems wise tbh

Overall it would be good to have ~$3,000 in the bank to safely cover basic
costs.

The capital contribution for the initial members will be based on answers
to questions about estimated costs, as well as the number of people who
are genuinely interested in being a part of this crazy thing.

I would suggest partners plan to make a $500 capital contribution.  If
that is too rich for anyone's blood (and even if not), let's all talk about
it and make sure everyone's comfortable.


**Who owns what % of the company — is it all equal?**

Option A: Even split per person; one member (I selfishly nominate myself) gets
an extra 1% in order to break ties.

Option B: Two levels of ownership, "partners" and "members", 90% is owned
by the partners and 10% is owned by the members.  Members are involved for the
fun; partners are involved at a more serious level.

Option C: People write down on a scale of 1 to 10 how involved they plan to be
and they get a weighted ownership based on that number.  We should really do this
exercise either way.

Think of the number as a "number of hours you plan on spending" thinking about
BIFFUD per week.

Here is a stab at descriptions of what the numbers might mean:

1-3: I'll keep track of what people are doing on slack; I'll follow
and RT on twitter; I'll occasionally contribute to a code base or otherwise offer
my expertise.
4-7: I'll lead and personally code or fund a BIFFUD project or two and participate
in the occasional meeting.
8-10: I will take a leadership role in the organization; plan to attend monthly
partner meetings, build multiple projects per year, and would seriously consider
telling someone I recently met that I'm part of this thing called Bad Idea Factory.


**Is governance weighted the same as ownership**

It doesn't have to be, I vote yes, but what do you think?


**Will I somehow wind up in jail?**

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

But seriously probably not, unless you do something illegal like rob a bank
with BIFFUD hats on.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2: Projects and Resources
---------------------------------------------------------------------

**What are the types of project at BIFFUD**

All projects need to be approved by the owners in order to be considered
a BIFFUD project.  People can obviously start working on projects at any
point and in any way, but basically for a project to get a repository on
BIFFUD's Github account, to have a project funded by BIFFUD, or to raise
external funds for a project in BIFFUD's name it has to be approved by
partner vote.

Some types of project BIFFUD might be involved in:

A. Grant funded: projects funded by a third party as a grant.  Money is
spent to build these, but the budget is handled by the person or people
who brought in the grant, and the grant's terms reign supreme.  In other
words, partners can't re-route funds from a grant unless the grant allows
it.

B. Individually inspired: projects that are being led or adopted by BIFFUD
members. BIFFUD Money isn't spent on these, but there is a degree of expectation
of quality and process around their execution.  NOTE: We need a mechanism for
a member to be able to fund their own projects -- pay for server space, URLs, or
maybe even hire people.  I think The LLC protections fall apart if members are paying
for company projects out of pocket, so we may need to think of something clever
here.  It could simply be that BIFFUD invoices the member in question for the
expenses associated with their projects.

C. BIFFUD Sponsored: some day there might be enough money in the bank to
actually fund development of projects.  This might be an individually
inspired project that the owners decide is worth supporting financially.

When projects are approved by the board they not only become official BIFFUD
projects, but stake in the project starts to get codified.  Members involved
in the project should collectively figure out what percentage stake they have
based on their expected involvement and contribution.

Stake in a project only matters because if a project brings in money it'll help
make sure that contributors feel fairly treated.

Example: Baron and I have both worked on Geochordinates; we would have a 50/50
stake in that project.

The point isn't to introduce negotiation or tension; I recommend that people
take an honest approach here.  We can figure out a process to resolve any
potential conflict here.

BIFFUD Sponsored projects won't affect ownership, but they do adjust the way
project profits are distributed, since BIFFUD would get a larger share back
to make up for money spent.


**How are profits distributed across members and project contributors?**
**Can you see profits from a project you don’t contribute to?**
**What “cut” will the organization take of profits to handle costs?**

For grant funded projects, grant funds are not considered profit.  Profits
that come from grant funded projects, however, are considered profit.

Profits for a project get split in a couple ways:

1. At the end of the year, BIFFUD expenses are added up and proportionally
removed from project profits until all expenses are covered.  This can be
covered in a formula but I'll wait until we all agree first.

2. The rest of the profit is actual profit.  Partners will be taxed on this,
but BIFFUD will pay members an amount to offset that tax liability in full.
Note, that if a partner actually earns income from BIFFUD, the partner would
be liable for any relevant tax there.

3. 50% of the remaining profits for a project are divided among project stakeholders
at a rate proportional to their noted stake.

4. The other 50% becomes company capital, which will be used to cover future
expenses, sponsor projects, throw FUDCON, buy emoji, or whatever else the owners
vote to pay for.


NOTE: the above doesn't cover projects where people pay personally; I don't know
if / how that can be handled without piercing the LLC veil.


**What does it mean to run or be part of a BIFFUD project?**
It's really hard to try to codify this.  BIFFUD is meant to be a source
of fun, not pressure.  That said, we want to treat it seriously and avoid
a pile of derelict projects.  Folks should just think of this as a group
who is inspired to build things together.  They should communicate, show
interest in one another's projects, and remember that we're a network of
smart and capable people!

Running a BIFFUD project should be seen as a chance to make something that
gets covered on wired, or hacker news, or The Onion.  It could earn money,
it could inspire laughter on the other side of the planet, or maybe it will just
make you smile when you think about it.

If the work starts getting tedious, or the humor dies, that's fine.  Not
every project that people start will be a winner, and maybe someone else
will pick it up later.


**How should projects be managed?**

Process around specific projects will be up to the person leading the project,
though there will be some standard components around documentation.  Those
components will be a blend of FOSS best practice and BIFFUD lulz.  For instance
projects are expected to maintain a QUOTES.md laying out noteworthy lines that
come out of a project's development.  A CONTRIBUTING.md explaining how a person
can contribute to the project or raise issues.

Github issues should be used when possible.  Commit messages should follow best
practices.  For multi-member / multi-contributor projects teams should strongly
consider using a process of branches and pull requests for the sake of making
it easy for future strangers to contribute and understand what's going on.

None of this is required or anything, but the more consistent the BIFFUD experience
is across projects, the easier it is going to be to expand our community.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3: Decision Making
---------------------------------------------------------------------

**How are decisions made around process and output?**

Process around specific projects will be up to the person leading the project,
though there will be some standard components around documentation.  Those
components will be a blend of FOSS best practice and BIFFUD lulz.  For instance
projects are expected to maintain a QUOTES.md laying out noteworthy lines that
come out of a project's development.  A CONTRIBUTING.md explaining how a person
can contribute to the project or raise issues.

Github issues, branches, and pull requests should be used for projects.


**How are decisions made around resources?**

Grant resources are dictated by the grant terms; so no decisions need to be made
there.

For money in BIFFUD's bank account, we will have a treasurer responsible for keeping
an eye on that.  The partners will need to vote to approve other expenses aside from
regular operating expenses such as taxes, legal fees, and banking fees.


**How are decisions made about what kinds of projects are part of BIFFUD?**

During monthly meetings the board will vote to approve new ideas.  We should
go into this with a reasonable collective understanding of what makes an idea
BIFFUD material, but ultimately it will be up to the board to determine in each
instance.

Some sample heuristics:

- Project should make people thinking face emoji
- Project should be realistic to implement with the resources available
- Project should have more than one member with meaningful stake (or be grant funded)
- Project should be "Chaotic Good" "Lawful Good" or "True Good"


** What are the kinds of decisions that voting members will be making?**
** What defines a quorum for that kind of decision?**

A. Introducing new members: how does equity redistribution work with new members
B. Removing members (? seems like there should be terms for this)
C. Accepting projects into BIFFUD
D. Removing projects: I'd like the bar to be reasonably high for why the board would decide to remove a project from BIFFUD.
E. Allocating / spending resources on company wide stuff (website, github account, etc)
F. Allocating / spending resources on specific BIFFUD projects (e.g. hiring a developer
or designer, paying for a domain name or server space, etc)
G. Accepting money from third parties / applying for money from third parties
H. Formal relationships / contracts with third parties
I. Policy changes / changes to the corporate repo that require board weigh-in

For each of these, what is the % of members who have to vote for a vote to count?
For each kind of vote, what is the % of votes that are needed for the motion to pass?
If there are multiple tiers of member, which ones vote for which types of decision?



---------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4: Important Stuff
---------------------------------------------------------------------

**What is our relationship with Open Source**

Everything made as part of BIFFUD, unless explicitly approved otherwise
by the partners, will be developed as open source projects using an MIT
License.


**What are all the things we want to incorporate into our operating agreement / bylaws**

- Emoji
- Attempts at SQL injection
- Puns (and corresponding pun ratings)
- A rickroll when you read the first letter of every line
- A project acceptance framework driven by D&D Alignment axis
- Notes about prioritizing buying a canoe and naming it "BIFFUD"
- Is BIFFUD pronounced BIFFUD or BIFFUD
- Required to have an algorithmically generated board meeting
- We want to avoid lawsuits between members

"Lets just pause and think for a moment about the majority of the movie twins"
"... Oh god we're the Danny DeVito of twins"
Idea for meeting votes: "We need emoji on a stick"

Emoji in github issues
