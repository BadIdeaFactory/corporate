At 17:13 Both Baron Oldenburg and Kate Darling blessed us with their
presence.

**Officer Reports:**
--------------------

**State of Biffud (Given by Overmind Dan Schultz)**

Overmind Dan reported we now have a bank account (\$).

He talked briefly about the agenda, etc.

**Opposition's Response (Given by Undermind Ted Han)**

Undermind Ted started undermining Dan at 10:14 by ignoring what Dan was
saying and informing everyone that Dan and he were willing to help or
answer people's questions in relation to processes, templates, confusion
about policy and whatever else.

**Loot Summary (Given by Treasure Goblin Lou Huang)**

Treasure Goblin reported only 4 people have deposited their contribution
money into the bank account. The bank account balance is at \~\$12,000.

Overmind informed us we need to still pay the lawyer.

Lou informed us that BIFFUD needs all Overlords to submit their
contribution (\$300 a person) as soon as possible, so get your asses
going. Technically everyone has 3 months to submit their contributions
(due November 30, 2017) but we need the loot in the bank account.

Erek left call at 17:17. We assume he was kidnapped or has a valid
excuse.

Our Almighty Overlord Dan failed to deposit a check live at 17:18. He
then attempted to download the correct application before getting
distracted and giving up. His example of how easy it was to do was not
inspiring.

**Social War Report (Given by The Popular One Kate Darling):**

The Popular One Kate informed us [[@BIFFUD has 124
followers]{.underline}](https://twitter.com/biffud/followers). They may
or may not be bots.

[[A Twitter
Battle]{.underline}](https://twitter.com/biffud/status/912421514473074690)
occured between [[@edbice]{.underline}](https://twitter.com/edbice) and
[[@biffud]{.underline}](https://twitter.com/biffud) where alternative
facts were exchanged.

Kate's approach to Twitter Battles is to treat it like Middle School
note exchanging. Therefore the opposite side gets the "last word" so
that we can double back at either a strategic or random point in time in
the future.

**Project Updates (Given by BeastMaster Mark Boas)**

Mark Boas updated us on Contextubot since he needed to depart early.
It's going well. Laura has been doing some "really cool" audio stuff.

\-\--

We discovered Slack has a limit to how many people can be on a phone
call at once.

\-\--

**Nerd Report (Given by Secretary of Code Anthony Buchanan)**

Secretary of Code informed us a wiki on how to use github and various
other information is needed for Overlords. It will be worked on at some
point in the nearish future.

**Culture Infusion (Given by Keeper of Lore Carolyn Rupar)**

Keeper of Lore reports nothing of interest.

\-\--

Dan's Strongbad impression was, luckily, lost due to general chaos.

\-\--

**New Overlord Applications:**
------------------------------

**Ian Anderson:**

🗳️ Result: 👍 Approved

Ian Anderson was not present on call since he didn't have internet
access. He was, however, on Slack begging to be allowed to join.

Ted helpfully read the application to all of us. Of interest: the
application was written in mark down and turned into a
[[brainfuck]{.underline}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)
program.

His piece of art submitted was a music piece called "Free Form Aim to
Misbehave".

It was received very well: Dan had tears of laughter and there was an
un-official motion for the piece to be used in the future for telephone
hold music and/or on the website.
