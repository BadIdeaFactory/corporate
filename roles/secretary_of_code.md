## Secretary of Code

**The Secretary of Code** helps us use technology to get stuff done around here for once.  They're responsible for figuring out ways to automate tasks, and generally overengineering our organization.  They also make sure that we are setting up technical resources so that BIFFUD projects can actually get things done efficiently.

### Example Secretary of Code visions:

1. Automate our business card generation.
2. Facial recognition for our plotting sessions so we know who is attending our meetings.
3. Random color rotations for social media brands.
4. Boilerplate repositories for various technology stacks.
5. Boilerplate CONTRIBUTING.md for new projects to adop.
6. Turn BIFFUD into a fully automated company, replacing the need for any human involvement.

### Example Secretary of Code tasks:
* Boilerplate repositories for various technology stacks.
* Documenting the tech tools / accounts that our members have access to.
* There's so much more brb.
