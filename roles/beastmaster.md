## Beastmaster

**The Beastmaster** is all about helping unlock the potential of our projects. This means helping them start, keep moving, share their stories, obtain resources, and contribute back to BIFFUD.

### Example Beastmaster visions:

1. Method for keeping track of what projects need.
2. Establishing systems for projects to obtain additional resources needed for their operation.
3. System / practices to help recruit interested people into those projects with needs.
4. Setting up templates for projects to share reports back to BIFFUD during plotting sessions.
5. Streamlining the project application and evaluation processes.
6. Helping to establish baseline / template contract language for project ownership agreements.
7. Creating a process for tracking project statuses.
8. Designing project on boarding processes (e.g. brand packets, documentation, access to resources, etc).
9. Organizing our AWS so that projects can get access to AWS resources.
