## Overmind

**The Overmind** fills in the gaps to ensure that the organization can continue to exist.  It's ultimately the role fo **the Overmind** to help make sure that corporate overlords care enough about BIFFUD to continue to be involved.

### Example Overmind visions:

1. Help BIFFUD take over the world.
2. Find major projects that BIFFUD associates can take on together.
3. Get Harvard to write a case study about BIFFUD.
4. Make sure we are operating as legally as possible.
5. Figure out how to update our bylaws and processes to get every corporate overlord to the point that they want to run at least one project through BIFFUD.
6. Help every single elected overlord execute on their visions.

### Example Overmind tasks:

* Any task from every other role that isn't being done.
* Working with **the Undermind** to define plotting session agendas.
* Reviewing / signing contracts and other legally binding documents related to BIFFUD.
