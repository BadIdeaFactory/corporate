## Undermind

**The Undermind** watches the **Overmind**'s every move and second guesses (or double checks) all of their decisions (for example: the typo in the second sentence of the Overmind's description).  In the event that **the Overmind** is unavailable to fulfill their duties, **the Undermind** must step in to ensure the organization continues to function.

### Example Undermind visions:

1. Help to take over BIFFUD
2. Help BIFFUD take over the world
3. Get Stanford to write a case study about BIFFUD
4. Make sure **the Overmind** is operating as legally as possible
5. Figure out how to update our bylaws and processes to get every corporate overlord to the point that they want to run at least one project through BIFFUD.
6. Help every single elected overlord execute on their visions.

### Example Undermind Tasks:

* Any of the tasks that the Overmind is not getting done fast enough.
* Planning the destiny for the organization with **the Overmind** & **the Treasure Goblin**
* Making certain that **the Overmind** isn't embezzeling money with **the Treasure Goblin**
* Making certain that **the Overmind** isn't signing contracts to do evil things
