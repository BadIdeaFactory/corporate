SECTION 1: üìöüìöüìö Official Operating Agreement üìöüìöüìö
---------------------------------------------------------------------
### Company Term
BIFFUD shall be dissolved as a Limited Liability Company if any of the following occur:

1. A vote to terminate the organization is passed by a Complete Consensus of Corporate Overlords.
2. The Hive Mind fails to hold a single meeting with quorum for a period of one consecutive year.
3. Everyone dies/there are no more Corporate Overlords.
4. If all Corporate Overlords identify as cis-hetero white men.

### Continuance of Company
If a Corporate Overlord leaves BIFFUD, dies, or uploads their brain to the cloud, the ownership of the remaining Corporate Overlords will then be evenly distributed (e.g., if four Corporate Overlords remain, each will own 1/4 of BIFFUD).

### Lawsuits Between BIFFUD Associates
All BIFFUD Associates involved in a lawsuit must play a group game of Mario Party 3 before any arbitration happens.  BIFFUD must lend any necessary hardware needed to make this possible.  Efforts must be made to obtain a Nintendo 64 for this endeavor, however, if obtaining such hardware would cause unreasonable burden, emulation is acceptable so long as a legal license for Mario Party 3 is first obtained by the Company.

If more than four Associates are involved in a lawsuit, a Mario Party 3 elimination tournament must be played.  The terms of the tournament shall be dictated by a neutral third party.

### Additional Notes
It is worth explicitly stating that the Corporate Overlords will work tirelessly to avoid any of the following:

- Giving up on their stakeholders.
- Letting anybody down to whom they have made a commitment.
- Disappearing/"running around" for long periods of time without communicating.
- Deserting one another as members without formally abdicating their stake.

Furthermore, they will try not to:

- Make anybody cry.
- Close the company and say "goodbye", so long as there someone is out there
willing to carry the torch forward.

Changes to Section 0 or Section 1 of this Operating Agreement shall require a Complete Consensus vote of the Hive Mind.

Changes to all other sections, or the creation of new sections, shall require a Strong Consensus vote of the Hive Mind.

At no point will any other section of this Operating Agreement override the terms or definitions laid out in Section 0 or 1.

SECTION 2: ü§ùü§ùü§ù Partnership ü§ùü§ùü§ù
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Types of Involvement
1. **Corporate Overlord:** Corporate Overlords maintain ownership stake in BIFFUD. They have votes during plotting sessions and can review pull requests to `corporate`.  Corporate Overlords may also maintain ownership stake in "**BIFFUD Projects**".

2. **Members:** Members may maintain ownership stake in "**Member Owned Projects**". Any sentient entity with ownership over a BIFFUD Project must also be a BIFFUD member unless they are Corporate Overlords.  Members are entitled to attend Plotting Sessions.

3. **Accomplices:** Accomplices are contributing participants in BIFFUD Projects. They might contribute via code, cash, or expertise. They are entitled to attend Plotting Sessions. Accomplices do not retain any ownership rights unless specified in a project's Ownership Agreement.

### Adding Corporate Overlords
Although previously thought impossible, an ancient ritual found buried in the ruins of Lawyer Cave describes the process of creating new Corporate Overlords.

Any Corporate Overlord may nominate an Overlord Candidate ("**Candidate**") during a plotting session.  If the nomination is seconded, the ritual begins.

1. The Hive Mind is presented with a biography of the Candidate.
2. The Candidate submits a piece of original poetry or other creative work for the Overlords' enjoyment and consideration.
3. A vote is held.

If the vote passes, as defined in Section 5, then after the Plotting Session ends the new Corporate Overlord is on-boarded and ownership of the company is redistributed so that each overlord owns an equal share.

### Removing Corporate Overlords
A Corporate Overlord can recuse itself from BIFFUD at any time by dying, uploading its consciousness to the cloud, or submitting a letter of resignation to the Overmind of BIFFUD, the Governor of Pennsylvania, and the President of the United States.

Corporate Overlords may also vote to remove a peer from the organization if any of the following conditions apply:

- The Corporate Overlord fails to attend 50% of the monthly plotting sessions in the current or previous fiscal year without a note from a family member explaining its absence.
- The Corporate Overlord has violated a serious federal law in the current or previous fiscal year.
- The Corporate Overlord is hated or despised.
- The Corporate Overlord fails to pay a required capital contribution within three months of notification.

The removal of a corporate overlord can be nominated during a plotting session and the vote must pass as defined in Section 5.

### Revenge of the Corporate Overlords

A former Corporate Overlord who previously left BIFFUD through one of the *voluntary* methods described under "**Removing Corporate Overlords**" (as opposed to removal via a vote of Corporate Overlords, or removal via breach of other rules in this Operating Agreement), may return to the company anew only via the full ritual described in "**Adding Corporate Overlords**."

### Hibernating Corporate Overlords
A Corporate Overlord can go into hibernation.  Hibernation does not remove their ownership of BIFFUD or their entitlement to profit share, but their role as a voting member of the Hive is temporarily revoked until they attend a plotting session.

Quorum and voting calculations do not include Corporate Overlords in hibernation.

There are two ways for Corporate Overlords to enter hibernation:

1. If a Corporate Overlord fails to attend four scheduled plotting sessions in a row, regardless of whether or not Quorum was met, they are automatically considered to be hibernating.

2. If a Corporate Overlord provides written communication to the Overmind that they wish to be placed into hibernation.

A Corporate Overlord exits hibernation immediately by attending a plotting session.

### Adding Members
Anybody with ownership over a BIFFUD Project is considered a BIFFUD Member.  Members must sign the Membership Contract found in `/documents/member_agreement.md`.

### Removing Members
Members may be removed from the organization by the Beastmaster when they are no longer associated with any BIFFUD projects.

### Adding Accomplices
Anybody with an accepted Pull Request in a BIFFUD project is automatically considered an Accomplice.  Before a Pull Request can be approved, the contributor must submit a signed Contributor License Agreement found in `/documents/accomplice_agreement.md`.

Project owners can also indicate who their accomplices are, even if they don't open pull requests (there are many ways to contribute to a project that doesn't involve code).

### Removing Accomplices
Accomplices can be removed by the beastmaster if it decides that is what is best.

### Corporate Overlord Responsibilities
Bad Idea Factory is a Limited Liability Corporation, which means that partnership can't _just_ be about the spirit or the lulz -- partners have legal responsibilities, ownership, and control over the Company direction.

Corporate Overlords are expected to:

1. Make a capital contribution upon joining.
2. Participate and vote in monthly plotting sessions.
3. Participate in reviews for changes to corporate GitHub.
4. Contribute original poetry on corporate GitHub.
5. Stay involved and aware of the projects being undertaken by members.
6. Help maintain and further the BIFFUD public footprint.
7. Try to attend BIFFUD events.
8. Adhere to the guidelines laid out in this document, particularly the spirit depicted in Section 1.

### Member Responsibilities
Members hold no responsibilities at the corporate level of BIFFUD.  They may have responsibilities outlined in their project-level agreements.

### Accomplice Responsibilities
Accomplices hold no responsibilities at the corporate level of BIFFUD.

### Elected Roles
In addition to base expectations, the following positions are to be held by Corporate Overlords.  Details of the election process are provided in Section 5.

- **Overmind (President):** Has a gavel.  The Overmind is responsible for running Plotting Sessions and signing contracts with third parties.

- **Undermind (Vice President):** Has a smaller gavel.  The Undermind is responsible for laughing whenever the Overmind makes a joke, fulfilling out the Overmind's duties if the Overmind goes into hibernation, and Undermin(d)ing the Overmind(ing).

- **Treasure Goblin (Treasurer):** Keeps track of money, works with accountants, oversees and approves small expenses.

- **Keeper of Lore (Secretary):** Ensures notes and minutes are taken for Plotting Sessions, ensures that proper CONTRIBUTING.md protocols are followed in `corporate`.

- **Secretary of Code:** Ensures that corporate defined commit protocols are followed in all BIFFUD projects, as well as `corporate`.

- **Beastmaster:** Makes certain decisions related to BIFFUD projects and ensures that the Corporate Overlords are aware of the progress and activity of BIFFUD projects.

- **The Popular One:** Handles public communication.  Runs BIFFUD social media accounts with input from other interested Corporate Overlords.

Detailed responsibilities of each role are explained in the corresponding `roles/*.md` file.  One person is allowed to fill more than one role, but the Overmind and Undermind must be separate people.

If nobody is willing to take on a role, Corporate Overlords are encouraged to send regular announcements to the Hive Mind through the loudest and most obnoxious mechanism at their disposal until the role is filled.

If an elected member goes into hibernation or decides to step down, a Fire Sale Election is to be held as described in Section 5.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3: ü§îü§îü§î Projects ü§îü§îü§î
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### BIFFUD Projects
BIFFUD exists to support the creation of projects.  These projects are approved by the Corporate Overlords, owned and maintained by Members, and built by Accomplices.

### Ownership Contracts
All "**Owners**"" of a project must be Members, and the percentages and specific terms of ownership must be coordinated by the Owners as part of the project's induction into the Company in the form of an Ownership Contract.

The Ownership Contract must specify participation expectations and ownership percentages, as well as guidelines for how potential profits should be distributed.

Changes to project ownership must be communicated to The Beastmaster.

### Project Resources
Resources required to complete or support a project can come from several different sources:

1. **Sponsored Support.** Includes resources from grants, gifts, or other payment from third parties.  Resources provided by a third party must be approved by the Overmind and must be distributed as per the third party's agreement.

2. **Member Support.** Includes resources directly provided by BIFFUD members; this may or may not be associated with ownership.

3. **BIFFUD Support.** Includes resources provided by the entire corporation. These resources represent expense and affect profit calculations at the end of the year.

4. **Profit Reinvestment.** At the end of the fiscal year a project may be allocated funds based on profit earned.  These funds can be distributed among owners or re-invested into the project.

5. **Raw Capitalism.** Apparently people think it's a good idea to hire a company called Bad Idea Factory. We're as surprised as you. Projects that bring in revenue in return for services are bound by the same rules as other projects in terms of how their money can be allocated.

### Disputes Between Project Owners
If project owners disagree, the Beastmaster will attempt to address the disagreement. If the Beastmaster fails to create harmony, the Beastmaster proposes a solution and if either the Undermind or Overmind approve it, the Owners in conflict must either accept that solution or mutually agree on an alternative.

### Retiring a BIFFUD Project
All BIFFUD projects, regardless of how they are resourced and supported, must be maintained and owned by at least one Member.  If a project no longer has a Member interested in owning it or if The Hive decides that the project should be removed from The Company, a motion may be passed to change the status to retired.

Any profits due to be distributed to a retired project are prorated in terms of how long the project was active during the fiscal year.  Any remaining profits are considered corporate profit.

The code base associated with a retired project should be kept in the BIFFUD repository.

Services that incur continuing costs to BIFFUD and are solely associated with retired projects should be ended by members of The Hive Mind as quickly as corporately possible.

### Evaluating Ideas
Anybody can build anything they want at any time, but in order for something to become an official BIFFUD project it must be formally adopted by the Corporate Overlords during a Plotting Session.  The determination of what makes a project a BIFFUD project is ultimately determined by that process, but in the spirit of framing the conversation, the following questions are recommended.

1. How is this project a bad idea?
2. Where are the lulz?
3. Does it make you thinking face emoji?
4. Is it realistic to implement through BIFFUD?
5. If the project were a character in Dungeons and Dragons, what would its alignment be?

The BIFFUD brand deserves compelling answers to questions one through three. Projects should be realistic to implement, and should be "Chaotic Good", "Neutral Good", or "Chaotic Neutral".  All of these data points simply serve as guidance. The ultimate decision of what projects should be adopted falls on the Corporate Overlords.

### The BIFFUD Executive Branch
Projects that are funded by third parties through grants or as a product for hire do not need to go through the same approval process. Instead, they must be approved by the Overmind, who is expected to consult with the Hive Mind and the rest of Corporate Overlords holding elected positions.

Corporate Overlords may apply for grants and seek out contracts with third parties so long as these efforts have been approved by the Overmind.

### The BIFFUD Operating Branch
The BIFFUD Operating Branch is the collective set of processes (and people) associated with corporate operations.  This includes things like invoicing, contracting, purachases, expenses, and filing taxes.  The nature and explicit responsibilities of the BIFFUD Operating Branch is determined by the Overmind with guidance from the Hive Mind.

### Supporting BIFFUD Projects
When a new BIFFUD project is approved we want it to actually get supported and built.  This means that if it is not already somehow funded, that it shall receive a $300 petty cash fund.

Projects shall specify a timeline by which the project will be implemented.  Once that date has passed, the Treasure Goblin will reclaim whatever remains of the petty cash fund.

Money allocated to a project is otherwise the same as any corporate allocation of funds (e.g. it is ultimately owed back to the corporation in the event a profit is earned, the comptroller determines how it should be spent, etc.)

Please note that this SHOULD NOT PREVENT ANYBODY FROM SUBMITTING SUPERFLOUS PROJECT APPLICATIONS. Please submit any and all bad ideas for approval even if you don't think actually they should be funded.

This dictation of petty cash does not apply to projects that were approved before December 1st, 2018.

### Intellectual Property/Internet Protocol
The following numbered clauses apply to all BIFFUD projects unless explicitly approved otherwise by the Corporate Overlords during project approval or at a later date during a Plotting Session.

1. Everything contributed to a BIFFUD project must be developed in the open and licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. If a Project has a license restriction imposed by a third party, the license shall be deemed acceptable without further approval if the license is a GPL-compatible license, as defined by the [Free Software Foundation's list of GPL-Compatible Free Software Licenses](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses). In all other situations, a Project may use another license by approval of Majority of the Corporate Overlords.

2. All BIFFUD projects must have the language written in `documents/federated_contributing.md` inserted into a CONTRIBUTING.md file at the root level of the project unless explicitly approved otherwise by the Corporate Overlords during project approval or at a later date during a Plotting Session.

3. Copyright and patent rights for all potential code or other creative works with a BIFFUD project must be granted to BIFFUD before it can be incorporated into a project, unless the Beastmaster gives their approval.

The Hive Mind has the ability to transfer Intellectual Property between BIFFUD and any external source (with approval of project owners) through approval of the Overmind, Undermind, and Beastmaster.  The Keeper of Lore is responsible for ensuring that documentation regarding the transfer is appropriately cataloged in `corporate`

---------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4: üíµüíµüíµ MONEY üíµüíµüíµ
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Capital Contributions
Corporate Overlords must contribute a $300 initial capital contribution
to BIFFUD within three months of indoctrination.

The Hive Mind can vote to increase the required capital contribution number,
as described in Section 5. Contribution increases are retroactive and Corporate
Overlords have three months to cough up the extra dough.

Failure to contribute in a timely manner shall result in revocation of Corporate Overlord status.

A former Corporate Overlord, returning to BIFFUD as described in Section 2 ->
"**Revenge of the Corporate Overlords**," may have the capital contribution
requirement waived via a vote of the Hive Mind.

### Third Party Contributions
Third parties can give money to BIFFUD as a non-deductible donation or grant.
Money donated in this way will be allocated according to the terms agreed upon by the Overmind, Treasure Goblin, and the third party.  Donations do not come
with any expectation of ownership of BIFFUD.

### Project Resources
The Hive Mind is responsible for allocating financial support to Projects.
Project owners must select a single person to be the project's "Comptroller" who is responsible for approving any invoices associated with a project and working with the Beastmaster and Treasure Goblin to receive access to centralized services or financial reimbursement, depending on the nature of the allocation.

Invoices that are not approved by a project's Comptroller will not be compensated unless they are explicitly approved by the Treasure Goblin.

### BIFFUD Tithe
2% of the gross income for any BIFFUD project shall be retained by the company and considered general operating funds.  It's really the least you could do.  In addition, 0.4% of the gross income for any BIFFUD effort (corporate or project based) shall be set aside into our "Grown Up Pants" fund in order to pay local business privilege taxes.

In addition to these fees, the Hive Mind should specify an additional "overhead" percentage to be retained by the company and added to the operating expense account.  Updating the universal or project specific overhead percentage requires a vote of the Hive Mind as described in the voting section.

The tithe + overhead applies to money earned through sales, contract agreements, donations, and any other way that cash could be given to a project from an external source.  Project owners are welcome to contribute more than the 2% if they are willing and able.

In some cases funders are not comfortable paying for this kind of general operating overhead; in these cases the Hive Mind may vote at any time to assuage a project of its tithe + overhead obligations, as described in the voting section of the bylaws.

Grown Up Pants fund contributions cannot be avoided, since they are associated with an external liability.

For example: Plorthank, the newest Corporate Overlord, has secured a $100,000 grant for a bad idea involving holograms.  $2,000 (2%) of that grant will be retained by the BIFFUD corporation and placed into their General Operating fund, $400 (0.4%) of that grant will be set aside to pay for local taxes, and $97,600 (97.6%) of the grant will be allocated to the hologram project.

### Distributing Project Money
After the BIFFUD Tithe, operating tax, and voluntary BIF contributions are accounted for within a project, whatever remains is the property of the project owners and is called the "Project Coffers".  Comptrollers (empowered by their respective project owners) determine the appropriations of the funds associated with their Project Coffers.

Some percentage of the funds inside Project Coffers will likely be used for project expense.  This might mean paying Associates who have helped build the project, or paying for important project assets such as amplified fog horns or skywriting-based-advertising.  Expenses and payments must be approved by the project comptroller.

Some percentage of the Project Coffers may be distributed to Project Owners.  This might mean paying project owners a flat rate, a percentage of gross income, or an arbitrary amount determined by those owners.  Anything is appropriate so long as it does not result in a net liability for the project.

All distributions from Project Coffers should be associated with documentation (e.g. a contract or written agreement) approved by the project Comptroller and registered with the BIFFUD Operating Branch.

All distributions from Project Coffers must be associated with an invoice approved by the project Comptroller and also registered with the BIFFUD Operating Branch.

Project Coffers cannot be overspent.  Any net liability associated with a project is the explicit responsibility of the project owners.

### Project Compensation and Contracts
Any compensation paid to individuals working on a project must be associated with a contract that has been approved by the comptroller of that project, and approved by the Overmind, and registered with the BIFFUD Operating Branch.

### Interproject Fund Transfers
A project Comptroller can opt to transfer Project Coffer funds into another Project Coffer.  This does not count as gross income for the receiving project for the purposes of Tithe, Overhead, and Grown up Pants.

Interproject transfers must be communicated to the BIFFUD Operating Branch using whatever process is in vogue at the time.

### Paying Back BIFFUD
If a project that had been allocated money from BIFFUD has any gross income, that project's coffers (not including the original allocation) shall be instantly deducted until the original allocation is offset in full.  In other words, project owners should pay back BIFFUD before paying themselves.

BIF Tithe and BIF Tax amounts do not count towards paying back BIFFUD.

### Interproject Loans
An interproject fund transfer can be specified as a loan.  This would result in similar processes to the one described in "Paying Back BIFFUD."  All loans are to be paid back in the order they were received.

In other words, BIFFUD gets paid back first, then projects get paid back in the order that loans were made.

### Corporate Coffers and Spoils of War
"Corporate Coffers" represent all undistributed corporate capital.

At the end of a fiscal year the net of all income and expense that is not associated with projects with owners (e.g. non-corporate projects) combined with all Tithe, Overhead, Grown up Pants, and Voluntary Contributions shall be added to the Corporate Coffers.

The net change to the Corporate Coffers (aka the profit or loss) in a given year shall be called "The Spoils of War" and shall be allocated to

### Payment Cadence
Everybody will be paid what they are due at whatever cadence is agreed upon between the relevant parties and also supported by processes agreed upon by the BIFFUD Operating Branch.

### Targeted Allocations
For Tax purposes, the following outlines explicitly how capital is to be allocated to Corporate Overlords in a given fiscal year with the following priority:

1. Corporate overlords are allocated any portion of Project Coffers that has been associated to them as described in the "Distributing Project Money" section.

2. Corporate overlords are allocated any portion of the Spoils of War according to their pro-rated ownership percentage for that year.

Put another way, Corporate Overlords are (1) entitled to a portion of relevant Project Coffers according to whatever has been determined within those projects' governance structures and then also (2) entitled to a percentage of corporate profit according to their pro-rated ownership percentage.

Project Owners who are not Corporate Overlords are still liable (from tax purposes) for whatever portions of Project Coffers that they are entitled to.

### Distributing Corporate Capital
A mandatory distribution will be made by May 31st to offset individual taxes owed by Corporate Overlords as a result of The Spoils of War.  Corporate Overlords may vote to prevent this distribution, as described in Section 5.  Corporate overlords must invoice BIFFUD with proof of their tax liability in order to be eligable for the reimbursement.

Corporate Overlords may vote at any time to distribute capital from Corporate Coffers in the Corporate Coffers in proportion of their net corporate capital positions.

### Project Resources
Project comptrollers have wide control over how the money associated with their projects can be spent, though they cannot spend more than the cash balance of their Project Coffers.  It is their responsibility to communicate approved expenses to the Treasure Goblin so that those expenses can be paid.

Licenses and assets obtained through a given project are property of the company, but the project owner shall be guaranteed as much use of it as needed (so long as project funds were used to pay for it). Comptrollers are urged to try to find assets that can be used by all BIFFUD projects.

For example: if a Comptroller purchased a web font to be rendered 50,000 times in total, that font should not be used in another BIFFUD project without explicit permission from the funding Comptroller.  On the other hand if a license was purchased for a reusable asset (e.g. a license to premium emoji) those assets could be used by any project.

Comptrollers may choose to use their budget to pay for additional seats on existing corporate systems (e.g. email, password management, etc.)

### Budget Requests
Members and Corporate Overlords may request the allocation of general operating funds for specific company or project expenses.  These allocation requests can be approved by the Hive Mind by voting during a plotting session (please see Governing Process section for details of voting).

Budget requests must include:

1. A specific amount.
2. A specific date by which the funds must be spent.
3. A description of how we know the "purchase" has been made.

If no specific date is set in the budget request, the funds shall be deallocated and returned to the general operating budget at the end of the fiscal year.

The Overmind shall make the determination if a purchase has been made, based on the description and/or its infinite wisdom as Overmind.  Once the purpose of a fund allocation has been achieved any remaining funds shall be returned to the general operating budget.

### Petty Cash Fund
One-time expenses under $100.00 may be approved and taken out of the corporate petty cash fund by the Treasure Goblin at any time, assuming the corporate petty cash fund has not been irresponsibly depleted. The Hive Mind must allocate a budget to the petty cash fund; it may replenish the petty cash fund throughout the year.

Allocations to the petty cash fund are returned to the general operating budget at the first plotting session of each fiscal year.  PRO TIP: This means it would be a good idea to allocate money to the petty cash fund at the first plotting session of each fiscal year.

### Operating Expense Budget
The BIFFUD overhead tax directly funds an "Operating Expense" account.  This account should be used to pay for necessary expenses accrued in order to run the business.  For example: book keeping, accounting, tax advisory, bank fees, and other core support mechanisms deemend reasonable at the discretion of the Overmind.

All Corporate Overlords are entitled to ask around about what this money is being spent on, but spending this money does not require a formal vote.

### Company Canoe
During the final Plotting Session of each fiscal year the Corporate Overlords must consider a vote on the purchase of a Company canoe, to be named and labeled the "BIFS BIFFUD Canoe".  If ever approved, the Corporate Overlords must update this agreement with a record of the achieved milestone as well as the identification of a new capitalistic goal and a new name.

All Company vehicles, ships, and other purchases must appropriately named. These names shall be cataloged by the Keeper of Lore.

Corporate ship names shall be prefixed by "BIFS" which will stand for "Bad Idea Factory Ship."

SECTION 5: üó£üó£üó£ Governing Process üó£üó£üó£
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Schedules and Expectations
All meaningful organizational decisions will happen in monthly Plotting
Sessions, which are to be scheduled and announced and publicly documented by the Keeper of Lore on April 1st of every year. The schedule can be updated as needed, but a notice of 10 days must be given before any Plotting Session can be held.

Notices of meetings are to be communicated via email notification and
published on GitHub `corporate` in CALENDAR.md

April 1st marks the beginning of the Governing Year, and all positions are considered open until re-filled.  During this time, previously elected officials maintain their positions temporarily.  An Election must be held during a Plotting Session in the month of April.  If an Election is not held in April then a Period of Anarchy occurs.

### Period of Anarchy
During a "**Period of Anarchy**", any Corporate Overlord able to gather enough of the Hive Mind in order to achieve quorum may chair a Fire Sale Election for any open role.  April 1st of every year is always considered a Period of Anarchy.

### April 1st
Votes cast during Plotting Sessions by Corporate Overlords on April 1st of every year are not real and motions can not actually be passed.  Votes and motions must still be recorded by the Keeper of Lore.

### Deliberation Processes
#### Plotting Session
Plotting Sessions are agenda driven and require a Quorum.  They are led by the chair (as determined by the Chain of Command).

The Hive Mind will use Robert's Rules of Order to run Plotting Sessions in an orderly and Robertly fashion.

When possible, video should be enabled for any plotting session.  Votes should be cast using physical emoji üëç, üëé, and üòê (or any skin tone variation) depicted on signs attached to sticks and held up to indicate votes of yes, no, and abstain respectively.  Members can also vote by raising their hands, or by voice, but this will be considered lame.

"Yar" and "Nar" are considered valid alternatives to "Aye" and "Nay" during voice votes.

A role call vote can take place instead if the Keeper of Lore or the meeting chair deems it necessary in order to properly tally a vote.

#### GitHub
Decisions made on GitHub are either interim decisions that must culminate in a Plotting Session to finalize, or they are decisions related to BIFFUD's GitHub process and documentation policy.

1. The person requesting a vote should review the instructions set forth in `CONTRIBUTING.md` based on the type of vote being requested.

2. A Pull Request must be made against the `master` branch of the BIFFUD corporate repository.

3. The Secretary of Code reviews the Pull Request and requests any changes related to standards violations or mistakes.

4. Once the Pull Request is deemed valid, the Secretary of Code requests a review from the relevant role.

5. Corporate Overlords may weigh in using comments.

6. Requests that require a Plotting Session are left open until a final vote is taken during a plotting session.  If a vote during a plotting session is associated with a Pull Request, The Keeper of Lore updates the Pull Request with a record of the vote outcome.

7. Requests that do not require a Plotting Session are left open until they pass or fail.  Requests that do not require a Plotting Session automatically fail if they have been open for over a month.

If a vote is considered preliminary, although actions may be triggered by initial indications of passage, the vote is not final until after a Plotting Session has been held.

If a vote is final and passes, the Pull Request is merged by the Keeper of Code and the branch is deleted.

If a vote is final and fails, the Pull Request is closed without merge by the Secretary of Code and the branch is deleted.


### Voting Decisions
The following decisions will require a formal input from the Hive Mind.

The GitHub processes for each decision are outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md and those processes should be followed.

- **Adding projects (Preliminary):** GitHub (needs Apathetic Support). This type of request is made by anybody who wants to submit their project or idea to BIFFUD for approval to become an official BIFFUD project. Upon preliminary approval the code base is incorporated into the BIFFUD repository and the Beastmaster provides the project owners with a biffud.com subdomain.

- **Adding projects:** Plotting Session (needs Strong Consensus). If the vote passes, the steps outlined in the preliminary vote description are invoked.  The listed owners of the project are made Members and onboarded by the Beastmaster.  The project budget is given to the Treasure Goblin for categorization.  The Beastmaster also now has permission to give access to any approved resources as required by the project.

- **Updating projects (Preliminary):** GitHub (needs Apathetic Support). This type of request is made by Owners of a project who want to update their project's application file after it has been approved.

- **Updating projects:** GitHub (with no money changes; needs Beastmaster Approval) or Plotting Session (needs Strong Consensus).  Any change that will require additional BIFFUD resources cannot be approved by the Beastmaster; it requires Strong Consensus during a Plotting Session.

- **Removing projects:** Plotting Session (needs Strong Consensus). If a project has been voted for removal from BIFFUD, the project must be removed from BIFFUD servers and team repository.  The transfer plan and timeline should be specified as part of the vote.  If it is not, the timeline is one month and the intent is to transfer related code and data to project owners.

- **Adding Corporate Overlords:** Plotting Session (needs Strong Consensus).

- **Removing Corporate Overlords:** Plotting Session (needs Strong Consensus).

- **Changing section 0 or 1 of `operating.md`:** Plotting Session (needs Complete Consensus). Note: this is as specified in Section 1 and repeated here for convenience.

- **Changing other sections of `operating.md`:** Plotting Session (needs Strong Consensus).

- **Allocating general operating funds (Preliminary):** GitHub (needs Majority). Preliminary approval of expenses above $100 but below $1,000 will allow the Treasure Goblin to release preliminarily approved funds at their discretion within the bounds of the approved expense timeline.  Note: the Treasure Goblin cannot approve their own expenses.

- **Allocating general operating funds:** Plotting Session (needs Strong Consensus). Upon approval the Treasure Goblin must release approved funds within the bounds of the approved expense timeline or the approval is voided.

- **Canceling tax reimbursement:** Plotting Session (needs Strong Consensus).  This vote indicates that the tax reimbursement to Corporate Overlords for company profits will not be distributed for the current fiscal year.

- **Soliciting one-time capital contributions:** Plotting Session (needs Complete Consensus).  This vote indicates that the Corporate Overlords will be required to make an additional capital contribution in order to remain Corporate Overlords.

- **Creating one-time capital disbursement:** Plotting Session (needs Strong Consensus).  This vote indicates that BIFFUD will disburse capital to Corporate Overlords in proportion to their ownership levels.

- **Adjusting the univeral overhead obligation:** Plotting Session (needs Simple Majority).  This vote updates the amount of overhead collected from funded projects' gross income.  Updates apply to all active projects unless an explicit exception is voted on.

- **Adjusting project-specific overhead obligation:** Plotting Session (needs Simple Majority).  This vote indicates that BIFFUD will adjust the overhead collected from a specific funded project's gross income.

- **Removing tithe obligation:** Plotting Session (needs Strong Consensus).  This vote indicates that BIFFUD will not require the 2% tithe from a project (the .4% for taxes still applies).

- **Making modifications to `CONTRIBUTING.md`:** GitHub (needs Apathetic Support).  This vote approves changes to the processes associated with the votes as described in CONTRIBUTING.md

- **Making other modifications to `corporate`:** GitHub (needs Apathetic Support).  This vote approves changes to the structure or organization of the corporate GitHub repository.

- **Approving minutes:** GitHub (needs Apathetic Support).  Minutes are submitted by the Keeper of Lore using the processes and standards defined in CONTRIBUTING.md.

### Elections
Elected terms end on April 1st and Elections for those seats are held during the Plotting Session held in March. Candidates must submit their application for a position 24 hours before the Plotting Session is scheduled to begin, using the process outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md.

Votes will be held using the Condorcet voting method.  In the event of a tie, then the tied candidates must choose champions.  The candidate whose champion can score highest in QWOP wins. If this also results in a tie then candidates must collect votes from people on the Internet for 24 hours, on any desired platform. The candidate with the most votes wins. In the event of another tie, pray that attrition causes a candidate to drop out.

If there is only one candidate for a given position the election requires a Majority vote.

If a Majority of Corporate Overlords abstain from voting for a particular position, the election results don't count.

### Fire Sale Elections
In the event that a Corporate Overlord holding an elected position goes into hibernation or chooses to step down from their elected position, or if any position is unfilled for any reason, then a Fire Sale Election is to be held to fill the vacant position.  Fire Sale Elections can happen during any Plotting Session and the voting process is the same as with regular Elections except that people are probably more excited.

### Records and Documentation
The `corporate` GitHub repository is our official record.  Minutes should be taken during Plotting Sessions, and it is the responsibility of the Keeper of Lore or a temporary appointee to take notes that reflect attendance, decisions, meaningful discussion, and vote counts.

The contents of the `corporate` GitHub make up the Company records. Documentation structure and organization should be performed as outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md.  The Secretary of Code is responsible for ensuring that the Keeper of Lore is adhering to the guidelines laid out in CONTRIBUTING.md.
