SECTION 1: üìöüìöüìö Official Operating Agreement üìöüìöüìö
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- [x] Company term
- [x] Continuance of company
- [x] Rickroll
- [x] Game of Mario Party 3 before legal arbitration between members

### Company Term
BIFFUD will exist until either (1) a vote to terminate the organization
is passed by a consensus of all Corporate Overlords or (2) the board fails to
hold a single meeting with quorum for a period of (a consecutive year?),
(3) everyone dies / there are no more Corporate Overlords, or (4) if all
Corporate Overlords are straight white cis men.

### Continuance of Company
If a Corporate Overlord leaves BIFFUD, dies, or uploads their brain to the
cloud, the ownership of the remaining corporate overlords will then be evenly
distributed (e.g. if four overlords remain, each will own 25% of BIFFUD)

### Lawsuits between BIFFUD associates
All BIFFUD associates involved in a lawsuit must play a group game of
Mario Party 3 before any arbitration happens.  BIFFUD will loan any
necessary hardware needed to make this possible.

### Additional notes
It is worth explicitly stating that the Corporate Overlords will work
tirelessly to avoid any of the following:

- Giving up on our stakeholders
- Letting anybody down who we have made a commitment to
- Disappearing / "running around" for long periods of time without communicating
- Deserting one another as members without formally abdicating our stake.

Furthermore, they will try not to:

- Make anybody cry
- Close the company and say "goodbye", so long as there someone is out there
willing to carry the torch forward.

SECTION 2: ü§ùü§ùü§ù Partnership ü§ùü§ùü§ù
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- [x] Types of involvement
- [x] Roles and responsibilities
- [x] Adding partners
- [x] Removing partners

### Types of Involvement
1. **Corporate Overlord:** Corporate Overlords of BIFFUD own part of the company.
They have votes during plotting sessions and can review pull requests to `/corporate`.

2. **Members:** members can have ownership over BIFFUD projects. All Corporate Overlords
are also members.  Members are entitled to attend BIFFUD meetings.

3. **Minions:** minions are contributing participants in BIFFUD projects. They
might contribute via code, cash, or expertise.  They are entitled to attend BIFFUD
meetings.


### Corporate Overlord Responsibilities
Bad Idea Factory is a Limited Liability Corporation, which means that
partnership can't ~just~ be about the spirit or the lulz -- partners
have legal responsibilities, ownership, and control over the company
direction.

Corporate Overlords are expected to...

1. Make a capital contribution upon joining.
2. Participate and vote in monthly plotting sessions.
3. Participate in reviews for changes to corporate GitHub.
4. Contribute original poetry on corporate GitHub.
5. Stay involved and aware of the projects being undertaken by members.
6. Help maintain and further the BIFFUD public footprint.
7. Try to attend BIFFUD events.

### Elected Roles
In addition to base expectations, the following positions are to be held
by corporate overlords.  They are elected annually:

- **President:** Has a gavel.  The President is responsible for merging
approved pull requests to `\corporate`.

- **Vice President:** Has a smaller gavel.  The Vice President is responsible
for laughing whenever the President makes a joke.

- **Treasurer:** Keeps track of money, works with accountants, oversees
and approves small expenses.

- **Secretary:** Ensures notes and minutes are taken for meetings,
ensures that proper CONTRIBUTING.md protocols are followed in `/corporate`.

- **Beastmaster:** Ensures that the corporate overlords are aware of the
progress and activity of BIFFUD projects.

These roles are responsible for overseeing their duties, though in some
cases that responsibility can take the form of setting up processes and
support networks.  For instance, the Beastmaster can delegate oversight
over a subset of BIFFUD projects if we have too many.

### Adding Corporate Overlords
Although previously thought impossible, an ancient ritual found buried
in the ruins of the Lawyer Cave describes the process of creating new
BIFFUD Corporate Overlords.

Any Corporate Overlord may nominate the addition of a new Overlord during
a plotting session.  If the nomination is seconded, the ritual begins.

1. The Corporate Overlords are presented with a biography of the candidate.
2. The candidate submits a piece of original poetry or other creative work
for the Overlords' enjoyment and consideration.
3. A vote is held.

If 70% or more of the Corporate Overlords approve the addition, then after the
plotting session ends the new Corporate Overlord is onboarded and ownership of
the company is redistributed so that each overlord owns an equal share.


### Removing Corporate Overlords
A Corporate Overlord can recuse itself from BIFFUD at any time by dying, uploading
its consciousness to the cloud, or submitting a letter of resignation to both
the President of BIFFUD and the President of the United States.

Corporate Overlords can also vote to remove a peer from the organization if
any of the following conditions apply:

- The Corporate Overlord fails to attend 50% of the monthly plotting sessions
in a given year without a note from a family member explaining its absence.
- The Corporate Overlord has violated a serious federal law in the past year.
- The Corporate Overlord is hated or despised.

The removal of a corporate overlord can be nominated during a plotting session
and requires 70% approval or more from the other Corporate Overlords.

Overlords are entitled to a pro-rated profit share for their tenure in a given
year, as well as ongoing profit-share according to their ownership of various
BIFFUD projects.

- [x] Types of project
- [x] Evaluating ideas
- [x] IP (Intellectual Property / Internet Protocol)
- [x] Open source

### Types of Project
A. **Grant Funded:** projects funded by grants from third parties are executed
by the BIFFUD member who has led the relationship with the funders, or by an
alternative BIFFUD member as delegated by that applicant.  Money associated with
a grant is to be distributed as per the grant's agreement.

B. **Member Owned:** projects that are led or adopted by BIFFUD members.  The
owners of a project must all be BIFFUD members, and the percentages and specific
terms of ownership should be define by those members as part of their application
for the adoption of the idea under BIFFUD.

C. **BIFFUD Core:** projects that are taken on by the entire corporation.  These
might be projects utilized by the Corporate Overlords to execute on company policy,
or simply be projects that the Corporate Overlords decide to develop without a concept
of individual ownership.


### Evaluating Ideas
Anybody can build anything they want at any time, but in order for something to become
an official BIFFUD project it must be formally adopted by the Corporate Overlords during
a plotting session.  The determination of what makes a project a BIFFUD project is
ultimately determined by that process, but in the spirit of framing the conversation,
the following questions are recommended.

1. How is this project a bad idea?
2. Does it make you thinking face emoji?
3. Is it realistic to implement through BIFFUD?
4. If the project were a character in Dungeons and Dragons, what would it's alignment be?

The BIFFUD brand deserves compelling answers to questions 1 and 2. Projects should be
realistic to implement, and should either be "Chaotic Good", "Neutral Good", or
"Chaotic Neutral".  All of these data points simply serve as guidance. The ultimate
decision of what projects should be adopted falls on the Corporate Overlords.


### Intellectial Property / Internet Protocol
The following numbered clauses apply to all BIFFUD projects unless explicitly approved
otherwise by the Corporate Overlords during project approval or at a later date during
a plotting session.

1. Everything contributed to a BIFFUD project must be developed in the open and licensed under
Apache 2.0.

2. All BIFFUD projects must have the language written in `documents/contributing_addition.md`
inserted into a CONTRIBUTING.md file at the root level of the project unless explicitly
approved otherwise by the Corporate Overlords during project approval or at a later date
during a plotting session.

3. Copyright for all potential code or other creative works with a BIFFUD project must be
granted to BIFFUD before it can be incorporated into a project, unless the Beastmaster gives
their approval.

### Capital Contributions
Each Corporate Overlord will contribute an $300 initial capital contribution
to BIFFUD within three months of achieving Corporate Overlord status.

Additional capital contributions can be voted on and approved by the
Corporate Overlords during a plotting session.

Question for Howard: how do we allow members *or* CO's to contribute
funds directly to specific BIFFUD projects without having equity impact?


### Allocating Resources to Projects
The Corporate Overlords can vote to assign budgets to BIFFUD Projects
which are then overseen by the project owners.  The project owners
must select a single person to be the project's "Cashier" who is
responsible for approving any invoices associated with a project or
working with the BIFFUD Treasurer to make purchases using BIFFUD funds.

At the time of budget approval the Corporate Overlords must specify if
the resources are being "given" or "loaned" to the project.

Invoices that are not approved by a project's Cashier will not be compensated
unless they are explicitly approved by the BIFFUD Treasurer.


### Distributing Profits
Profits are to be calculated at the end of the fiscal year.  If by
some miracle there are profits on a given year, the following formula
will dictate its distribution

1. A mandatory distribution of profit will be made to offset individual
taxes on that profit.  Corporate Overlords may choose to prevent this
distribution my making a 70% vote during a plotting session.

2. 60% of the remaining funds will be distributed to the projects
in proportion to the project-level profit distribution.

2b. If a project has a profit allocation and the project had been allocated
a "loan" from BIFFUD, that project's allocated profit is reduced by BIFFUD
and subtracted from the outstanding balance.

2c. The project owners may vote to decide to either distribute the profits
proportionally according to their percentage ownership of the project, or
to allocate the profit towards future project expenses.

3. The remaining 40% of the profits is kept by BIFFUD.

3b. 50% of the remaining BIFFUD profits is to be distributed to the Corporate
Overlords in terms of their ownership percentage.  The remaining 50% is to
be kept as corporate funds.  The Corporate Overlords may adjust this ratio
for a given year during a monthly plotting session.


### Compensation
Any compensation paid to individuals working on a project must be associated
with a contract that has either been approved by the Treasurer or by the
Corporate Overlords during a plotting session.


### Expenses
Members and Coporate Overlords may receive reimbursement for expenses associated
with a project through the processes outlined in the "Allocating Resources For
Projects" section.

Expenses under $100.00 may be approved by the Treasurer at any time or can be
approved by Corporate Overlords during a plotting session.  All other expenses
must be approved by Corporate Overlords during a plotting session.


### Company Canoe
During the plotting session at the end of each fiscal year the Corporate Overlords
must consider a vote on the purchase of a company canoe, to be named and labeled the
"BIFFUD Canoe".  If ever approved, the Corporate Overlords must update this agreement
with a record of the achieved milestone as well as the identification of a new
capitalistic goal.
