SECTION 1: 📚📚📚 Official Operating Agreement 📚📚📚
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- [x] Company term
- [x] Continuance of company
- [x] Rickroll
- [x] Game of Mario Party 3 before legal arbitration between members

### Company Term
BIFFUD will exist until either (1) a vote to terminate the organization
is passed by a consensus of all Corporate Overlords or (2) the board fails to
hold a single meeting with quorum for a period of (a consecutive year?),
(3) everyone dies / there are no more Corporate Overlords, or (4) if all
Corporate Overlords are straight white cis men.

### Continuance of Company
If a Corporate Overlord leaves BIFFUD, dies, or uploads their brain to the
cloud, the ownership of the remaining corporate overlords will then be evenly
distributed (e.g. if four overlords remain, each will own 25% of BIFFUD)

### Lawsuits between BIFFUD associates
All BIFFUD associates involved in a lawsuit must play a group game of
Mario Party 3 before any arbitration happens.  BIFFUD will loan any
necessary hardware needed to make this possible.

### Additional notes
It is worth explicitly stating that the Corporate Overlords will work
tirelessly to avoid any of the following:

- Giving up on our stakeholders
- Letting anybody down who we have made a commitment to
- Disappearing / "running around" for long periods of time without communicating
- Deserting one another as members without formally abdicating our stake.

Furthermore, they will try not to:

- Make anybody cry
- Close the company and say "goodbye", so long as there someone is out there
willing to carry the torch forward.
