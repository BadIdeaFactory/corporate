SECTION 1: 📚📚📚 Official Operating Agreement 📚📚📚
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- [x] Company term
- [x] Continuance of company
- [x] Rickroll
- [x] Game of Mario Party 3 before legal arbitration between members

### Company Term
BIFFUD will exist until either (1) a vote to terminate the organization
is passed by a Complete Consensus of Corporate Overlords or (2) the Hive Mind fails to
hold a single meeting with quorum for a period of a consecutive year,
(3) everyone dies / there are no more Corporate Overlords, or (4) if all
Corporate Overlords identify as hetero cis white men.

### Continuance of Company
If a Corporate Overlord leaves BIFFUD, dies, or uploads their brain to the
cloud, the ownership of the remaining Corporate Overlords will then be evenly
distributed (e.g. if four Corporate Overlords remain, each will own 1/4 of BIFFUD).

### Lawsuits Between BIFFUD Associates
All BIFFUD associates involved in a lawsuit must play a group game of
Mario Party 3 before any arbitration happens.  BIFFUD will loan any
necessary hardware needed to make this possible.  Efforts must be made
to obtain a Nintendo 64, however if obtaining such hardware would cause
unreasonable burden, emulation is acceptable so long as a legal license
for Mario Party 3 is first obtained by the Company.

If more than four associates are involved in a lawsuit, a Mario Party
elimination tournament must be played.  The terms of the tournament shall
be dictated by a neutral third party.

### Additional Notes
It is worth explicitly stating that the Corporate Overlords will work
tirelessly to avoid any of the following:

- Giving up on their stakeholders.
- Letting anybody down to whom they have made a commitment.
- Disappearing / "running around" for long periods of time without communicating.
- Deserting one another as members without formally abdicating their stake.

Furthermore, they will try not to:

- Make anybody cry.
- Close the company and say "goodbye", so long as there someone is out there
willing to carry the torch forward.

Changes to Section 0 or Section 1 of this Operating Agreement will require a
Complete Consensus vote of the Hive Mind.

Changes to all other sections, or the creation of new sections, will reqire
a Strong Consensus vote of the Hive Mind.

At no point will any other section of this Operating Agreement override the
terms or definitions laid out in Section 0 or 1.
