### Types of Involvement
1. **Corporate Overlord:** Corporate Overlords maintain ownership stake in the
BIFFUD corporation. They have votes during plotting sessions and can review pull
requests to `/corporate`.  Corporate Overlords may also maintain ownership stake
in BIFFUD Projects.

2. **Members:** Members may maintain ownership stake in Member Owned Projects. Any
sentient entity with ownership over a BIFFUD project must also be a BIFFUD member
unless they are Corporate Overlords.  Members are entitled to attend BIFFUD
meetings.

3. **Minions:** minions are contributing participants in BIFFUD projects. They
might contribute via code, cash, or expertise.  They are entitled to attend BIFFUD
meetings.  Minions do not retain any ownership rights.

### Adding Corporate Overlords
Although previously thought impossible, an ancient ritual found buried
in the ruins of Lawyer Cave describes the process of creating new
Corporate Overlords.

Any Corporate Overlord may nominate an Overlord Candidate during
a plotting session.  If the nomination is seconded, the ritual begins.

1. The Hive Mind is presented with a biography of the candidate.
2. The Overlord Candidate submits a piece of original poetry or other creative
work for the Overlords' enjoyment and consideration.
3. A vote is held.

If the vote passes, as defined in Section 5, then after the Plotting Session
ends the new Corporate Overlord is onboarded and ownership of the company is
redistributed so that each overlord owns an equal share.


### Removing Corporate Overlords
A Corporate Overlord can recuse itself from BIFFUD at any time by dying, uploading
its consciousness to the cloud, or submitting a letter of resignation to the
President of BIFFUD, the Governor of Pennsylvania, and the President of the
United States.

Corporate Overlords can also vote to remove a peer from the organization if
any of the following conditions apply:

- The Corporate Overlord fails to attend 50% of the monthly plotting sessions
in a given year without a note from a family member explaining its absence.
- The Corporate Overlord has violated a serious federal law in the past year.
- The Corporate Overlord is hated or despised.
- The Corporate Overlord fails to pay a required capital contribution within
three months of notification.

The removal of a corporate overlord can be nominated during a plotting session
and the vote must pass as defined in Section 5.


### Hibernating Corporate Overlords
A Corporate Overlord can go into hibernation.  Hibernation does not remove their
ownership of BIFFUD or their entitlement to profit share, but their role as a voting
member of the Hive is temporarily revoked until they attend a plotting session.
Quorum and voting calculations do not include Corporate Overlords in hibernation.

There are two ways for Corporate Overlords to enter hibernation:

1. If a Corporate Overlord fails to attend four scheduled plotting sessions in a row,
regardless of whether or not Quorum was met, they are automaically considered to be
hibernating.

2. If a Corporate Overlord provides written communication to the Overmind that they
wish to be placed into hibernation.

A Corporate Overlord exits hibernation immediately by attending a plotting session.


### Adding Members
Anybody with ownership over a BIFFUD Project is considered a BIFFUD Member.  Members
must sign the membership contract found in `/documents/member_agreement.md`.


### Removing Members
Members are removed from the organization when they are no longer associated with any
BIFFUD projects.


### Adding Minions
Anybody with an accepted Pull Request in a BIFFUD project is automatically considered
a minion.  Before a Pull Request can be approved, the contributor must submit a signed
contributor license agreement found in `/documents/minion_agreement.md`.


### Removing Minions
Minions lose their status automatically one year after their most recent contribution
to a BIFFUD project.


### Corporate Overlord Responsibilities
Bad Idea Factory is a Limited Liability Corporation, which means that
partnership can't _just_ be about the spirit or the lulz -- partners
have legal responsibilities, ownership, and control over the company
direction.

Corporate Overlords are expected to...

1. Make a capital contribution upon joining.
2. Participate and vote in monthly plotting sessions.
3. Participate in reviews for changes to corporate GitHub.
4. Contribute original poetry on corporate GitHub.
5. Stay involved and aware of the projects being undertaken by members.
6. Help maintain and further the BIFFUD public footprint.
7. Try to attend BIFFUD events.
8. Adhere to the guidelines laid out in this document, particularly the
spirit depicted in Section 1.


### Member Responsibilities
Members hold no responsibilities at the corporate level of BIFFUD.  They
may have responsibilities outlined in their project-level agreements.


### Minion Responsibilities
Minions hold no responsibilities at the corporate level of BIFFUD.


### Elected Roles
In addition to base expectations, the following positions are to be held
by corporate overlords.  They are elected annually.  Details of the election
process are explained in Section 5.

- **Overmind (President):** Has a gavel.  The President is responsible for
running Plotting Sessions and signing contracts with third parties.

- **Undermind (Vice President):** Has a smaller gavel.  The Vice President
is responsible for laughing whenever the President makes a joke and filling
out the President's duties if the President goes into hibernation.

- **Treasure Goblin (Treasurer):** Keeps track of money, works with accountants, oversees
and approves small expenses.

- **Keeper of Lore (Secretary):** Ensures notes and minutes are taken for meetings,
ensures that proper CONTRIBUTING.md protocols are followed in `/corporate`.

- **Keeper of Code:** Ensures that corporate defined commit protocols are
followed in all BIFFUD projects, as well as `/corporate`.

- **Beastmaster:** Makes interim decisions related to BIFFUD projects and
ensures that the corporate overlords are aware of the progress and activity
of BIFFUD projects.

- **The Popular One:** Runs our social media accounts with input from other
interested Corporate Overlords.

Detailed responsibilities of each role are explained in the corresponding
`roles/*.md` file.

If nobody is willing to take on a role, Corporate Overlords are encouraged to
send regular announcements to The Hive through the loudest and most obnoxious
mechanism at their disposal until the role is filled.
