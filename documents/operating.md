SECTION 1: üìöüìöüìö Official Operating Agreement üìöüìöüìö
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- [x] Company term
- [x] Continuance of company
- [x] Rickroll
- [x] Game of Mario Party 3 before legal arbitration between members

### Company Term
BIFFUD will exist until either (1) a vote to terminate the organization
is passed by a Complete Consensus of Corporate Overlords or (2) the Hive Mind fails to
hold a single meeting with quorum for a period of a consecutive year,
(3) everyone dies / there are no more Corporate Overlords, or (4) if all
Corporate Overlords identify as hetero cis white men.

### Continuance of Company
If a Corporate Overlord leaves BIFFUD, dies, or uploads their brain to the
cloud, the ownership of the remaining Corporate Overlords will then be evenly
distributed (e.g. if four Corporate Overlords remain, each will own 1/4 of BIFFUD).

### Lawsuits Between BIFFUD Associates
All BIFFUD associates involved in a lawsuit must play a group game of
Mario Party 3 before any arbitration happens.  BIFFUD will loan any
necessary hardware needed to make this possible.  Efforts must be made
to obtain a Nintendo 64, however if obtaining such hardware would cause
unreasonable burden, emulation is acceptable so long as a legal license
for Mario Party 3 is first obtained by the Company.

If more than four associates are involved in a lawsuit, a Mario Party
elimination tournament must be played.  The terms of the tournament shall
be dictated by a neutral third party.

### Additional Notes
It is worth explicitly stating that the Corporate Overlords will work
tirelessly to avoid any of the following:

- Giving up on their stakeholders.
- Letting anybody down to whom they have made a commitment.
- Disappearing / "running around" for long periods of time without communicating.
- Deserting one another as members without formally abdicating their stake.

Furthermore, they will try not to:

- Make anybody cry.
- Close the company and say "goodbye", so long as there someone is out there
willing to carry the torch forward.

Changes to Section 0 or Section 1 of this Operating Agreement will require a
Complete Consensus vote of the Hive Mind.

Changes to all other sections, or the creation of new sections, will reqire
a Strong Consensus vote of the Hive Mind.

At no point will any other section of this Operating Agreement override the
terms or definitions laid out in Section 0 or 1.

SECTION 2: ü§ùü§ùü§ù Partnership ü§ùü§ùü§ù
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- [x] Types of involvement
- [x] Roles and responsibilities
- [x] Adding partners
- [x] Removing partners

### Types of Involvement
1. **Corporate Overlord:** Corporate Overlords maintain ownership stake in the
BIFFUD corporation. They have votes during plotting sessions and can review pull
requests to `/corporate`.  Corporate Overlords may also maintain ownership stake
in BIFFUD Projects.

2. **Members:** Members may maintain ownership stake in Member Owned Projects. Any
sentient entity with ownership over a BIFFUD project must also be a BIFFUD member
unless they are Corporate Overlords.  Members are entitled to attend BIFFUD
meetings.

3. **Minions:** minions are contributing participants in BIFFUD projects. They
might contribute via code, cash, or expertise.  They are entitled to attend BIFFUD
meetings.  Minions do not retain any ownership rights.

### Adding Corporate Overlords
Although previously thought impossible, an ancient ritual found buried
in the ruins of Lawyer Cave describes the process of creating new
Corporate Overlords.

Any Corporate Overlord may nominate an Overlord Candidate during
a plotting session.  If the nomination is seconded, the ritual begins.

1. The Hive Mind is presented with a biography of the candidate.
2. The Overlord Candidate submits a piece of original poetry or other creative
work for the Overlords' enjoyment and consideration.
3. A vote is held.

If the vote passes, as defined in Section 5, then after the Plotting Session
ends the new Corporate Overlord is onboarded and ownership of the company is
redistributed so that each overlord owns an equal share.


### Removing Corporate Overlords
A Corporate Overlord can recuse itself from BIFFUD at any time by dying, uploading
its consciousness to the cloud, or submitting a letter of resignation to the
President of BIFFUD, the Governor of Pennsylvania, and the President of the
United States.

Corporate Overlords can also vote to remove a peer from the organization if
any of the following conditions apply:

- The Corporate Overlord fails to attend 50% of the monthly plotting sessions
in a given year without a note from a family member explaining its absence.
- The Corporate Overlord has violated a serious federal law in the past year.
- The Corporate Overlord is hated or despised.
- The Corporate Overlord fails to pay a required capital contribution within
three months of notification.

The removal of a corporate overlord can be nominated during a plotting session
and the vote must pass as defined in Section 5.


### Hibernating Corporate Overlords
A Corporate Overlord can go into hibernation.  Hibernation does not remove their
ownership of BIFFUD or their entitlement to profit share, but their role as a voting
member of the Hive is temporarily revoked until they attend a plotting session.
Quorum and voting calculations do not include Corporate Overlords in hibernation.

There are two ways for Corporate Overlords to enter hibernation:

1. If a Corporate Overlord fails to attend four scheduled plotting sessions in a row,
regardless of whether or not Quorum was met, they are automaically considered to be
hibernating.

2. If a Corporate Overlord provides written communication to the Overmind that they
wish to be placed into hibernation.

A Corporate Overlord exits hibernation immediately by attending a plotting session.


### Adding Members
Anybody with ownership over a BIFFUD Project is considered a BIFFUD Member.  Members
must sign the membership contract found in `/documents/member_agreement.md`.


### Removing Members
Members are removed from the organization when they are no longer associated with any
BIFFUD projects.


### Adding Minions
Anybody with an accepted Pull Request in a BIFFUD project is automatically considered
a minion.  Before a Pull Request can be approved, the contributor must submit a signed
contributor license agreement found in `/documents/minion_agreement.md`.


### Removing Minions
Minions lose their status automatically one year after their most recent contribution
to a BIFFUD project.


### Corporate Overlord Responsibilities
Bad Idea Factory is a Limited Liability Corporation, which means that
partnership can't _just_ be about the spirit or the lulz -- partners
have legal responsibilities, ownership, and control over the company
direction.

Corporate Overlords are expected to...

1. Make a capital contribution upon joining.
2. Participate and vote in monthly plotting sessions.
3. Participate in reviews for changes to corporate GitHub.
4. Contribute original poetry on corporate GitHub.
5. Stay involved and aware of the projects being undertaken by members.
6. Help maintain and further the BIFFUD public footprint.
7. Try to attend BIFFUD events.
8. Adhere to the guidelines laid out in this document, particularly the
spirit depicted in Section 1.


### Member Responsibilities
Members hold no responsibilities at the corporate level of BIFFUD.  They
may have responsibilities outlined in their project-level agreements.


### Minion Responsibilities
Minions hold no responsibilities at the corporate level of BIFFUD.


### Elected Roles
In addition to base expectations, the following positions are to be held
by corporate overlords.  They are elected annually.  Details of the election
process are explained in Section 5.

- **Overmind (President):** Has a gavel.  The President is responsible for
running Plotting Sessions and signing contracts with third parties.

- **Undermind (Vice President):** Has a smaller gavel.  The Vice President
is responsible for laughing whenever the President makes a joke and filling
out the President's duties if the President goes into hibernation.

- **Treasure Goblin (Treasurer):** Keeps track of money, works with accountants, oversees
and approves small expenses.

- **Keeper of Lore (Secretary):** Ensures notes and minutes are taken for meetings,
ensures that proper CONTRIBUTING.md protocols are followed in `/corporate`.

- **Keeper of Code:** Ensures that corporate defined commit protocols are
followed in all BIFFUD projects, as well as `/corporate`.

- **Beastmaster:** Makes interim decisions related to BIFFUD projects and
ensures that the corporate overlords are aware of the progress and activity
of BIFFUD projects.

- **The Popular One:** Runs our social media accounts with input from other
interested Corporate Overlords.

Detailed responsibilities of each role are explained in the corresponding
`roles/*.md` file.

If nobody is willing to take on a role, Corporate Overlords are encouraged to
send regular announcements to The Hive through the loudest and most obnoxious
mechanism at their disposal until the role is filled.

SECTION 3: ü§îü§îü§î Projects ü§îü§îü§î
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- [x] Types of project
- [x] Evaluating ideas
- [x] IP (Intellectual Property / Internet Protocol)
- [x] Open source
- [x] When a project should be considered retired
- [x] Removing a project from BIFFUD
- [ ] Adopting IP from existing entities / projects
- [ ] Reallocating copyright / IP upon spinoff

### BIFFUD Projects
BIFFUD exists to support the creation of projects.  These projects are
approved by the Corporate Overlords, owned and maintained by Members,
and built by Minions.

### Ownership Contracts
All owners of a project must be BIFFUD members, and the percentages and specific
terms of ownership must be coordinated by those members as part of the project's
induction into The Company in the form of an Ownership Contract.

The Ownership Contract should specify participation expectations
and ownership percentages, as well as guidelines for how potential profits
should be distributed.

Changes to project ownership over time must be communicated to The Beastmaster.

### Project Resources
Resources required to complete or support a project can come from several
different sources:

A. **Sponsored support** includes resources from grants, gifts, or other payment
from third parties.  Resources provided by a third party must be approved by the
Overmind and must be distributed as per the third party's agreement.

B. **Member Support** includes resources directly provided by BIFFUD members;
this may or may not be associated with ownership.

C. **BIFFUD Support** includes resources provided by the entire corporation.  These
resources represent expense and affect profit calculations at the end of the year.

D. **Profit Reinvestment** at the end of the fiscal year a project may be allocated
funds based on profit earned.  These funds can be distributed among owners or re-invested
into the project.


### Disputes Between Project Owners
If project owners disagree, the Beastmaster is responsible for addressing the
disagreement.  If the beastmaster fails to create harmony, the Beastmaster proposes a
solution and if either the Undermind or Overmind approve it, the Owners in conflict can
either accept that solution or mutually agree on an alternative.

### Retiring a BIFFUD Project
All BIFFUD projects, regardless of how they are resourced and supported,
must be maintained and owned by at least one member of BIFFUD.  If a project
no longer has a BIFFUD member interested in owning it or if The Hive decides that
the project should be removed from The Company, a motion can be passed to change the status
to retired.

Any profits due to be distributed to a retired project are pro rated in terms of how long
the project was active during the fiscal year.  Any remaining profits are considered corporate
profit.

The code base associated with a retired project should be kept in the BIFFUD repository.

Services that incur continuing costs to BIFFUD and are solely associated with retired
projects should be ended by members of The Hive Mind as quickly as corporately possible.

### Evaluating Ideas
Anybody can build anything they want at any time, but in order for something to become
an official BIFFUD project it must be formally adopted by the Corporate Overlords during
a plotting session.  The determination of what makes a project a BIFFUD project is
ultimately determined by that process, but in the spirit of framing the conversation,
the following questions are recommended.

1. How is this project a bad idea?
2. Where are the lulz?
3. Does it make you thinking face emoji?
4. Is it realistic to implement through BIFFUD?
5. If the project were a character in Dungeons and Dragons, what would it's alignment be?

The BIFFUD brand deserves compelling answers to questions 1 and 2. Projects should be
realistic to implement, and should be "Chaotic Good", "Neutral Good", or
"Chaotic Neutral".  All of these data points simply serve as guidance. The ultimate
decision of what projects should be adopted falls on the Corporate Overlords.

### Intellectial Property / Internet Protocol
The following numbered clauses apply to all BIFFUD projects unless explicitly approved
otherwise by the Corporate Overlords during project approval or at a later date during
a plotting session.

1. Everything contributed to a BIFFUD project must be developed in the open and licensed
under the Apache License, Version 2.0. A Project may use another license by approval of
Majority of the Corporate Overlords (for example, if another license is necessary for the
purposes of fulfilling third party funding requirements, or if a copyleft license better suits
the goals of the Project).

2. All BIFFUD projects must have the language written in `documents/contributing_addition.md`
inserted into a CONTRIBUTING.md file at the root level of the project unless explicitly
approved otherwise by the Corporate Overlords during project approval or at a later date
during a plotting session.

3. Copyright and patent rights for all potential code or other creative works with a BIFFUD
project must be granted to BIFFUD before it can be incorporated into a project, unless the
Beastmaster gives their approval.

The Hive Mind has the ability to transfer IP to or from external sources (with approval of
project owners).  These actions require a Majority vote of the Corporate Overlords.

- [x] Company canoe


### Capital Contributions
Corporate Overlords must contribute a $300 initial capital contribution
to BIFFUD within three months of indoctrination.

The Hive Mind can vote to increase the required capitalcontribution number,
as described in Section 5. Contribution increases are retroactive and Corporate
Overlords have 3 months to cough up the extra dough.

### Third Party contributions
Third parties can give money to BIFFUD as a non-deductable donation or grant,
and that money will be allocated according to the terms agreed upon by the
Overmind, Treasure Goblin, and the third party.  These donations do not come
with any expectation of ownership of BIFFUD.

### Organizational Resources
The Overmind may submit budget requests to The Hive Mind for resources
that will be used by BIFFUD as an organization.  For example, for licenses,
services, fonts, La Croix, or other assets that need cash money to obtain.

### Project Resources
The Hive Mind is responsible for allocating financial support to BIFFUD Projects.
The project owners must select a single person to be the project's "Comptroller" who
is responsible for approving any invoices associated with a project and working with
the Beastmaster and Treasure Goblin to receive access to centralized services or
financial reimbursement, depending on the nature of the allocation.

At the time of budget approval the Corporate Overlords must specify if
the resources are being "given" or "loaned" to the project.

Invoices that are not approved by a project's Cashier will not be compensated
unless they are explicitly approved by the Treasure Goblin.

### Distributing Profits
Profits are calculated at the end of the fiscal year ((Howard To Define)).  If by
some miracle there are profits on a given year, the following formula
will dictate its distribution:

1. A mandatory distribution of profit will be made to offset individual
taxes on that profit.  Corporate Overlords may vote to prevent this
distribution, as described in Section 5.  Whatever is left shall be called
the Spoils of War.

2. 60% of the Spoils of War will be distributed to the projects in proportion
to the project-level profit distribution.  For example, if a project earned
70% of BIFFUD's total profit, that profit would be allocated 70% of the 60% of
the Spoils of War.

2b. If a project has a profit allocation and the project had been allocated
a "loan" from BIFFUD, that project's allocated profit is reduced by BIFFUD
and subtracted from the outstanding balance.

2c. The project owners are paid in proportion to their project ownership
percentage.

3. 20% of the Spoils of War shall be distributed to the Corporate Overlords
in proportion of their pro-rated ownership percentage.  For example, if a Corporate
Overlord was only part of The Hive Mind for half of a year their pro-rated ownership
percentage would be half that of a full-term Corporate Overlord's.

4. 20% of the Spoils of War shall be added to the company coffers.

### Compensation
Any compensation paid to individuals working on a project must be associated
with a contract that has either been approved by the Treasurer and Overmind.

### Expenses
Members and Coporate Overlords may receive reimbursement for expenses associated
with a project through the processes outlined in the "Allocating Resources For
Projects" section.

One-time expenses under $100.00 may be approved by the Treasurer at any time.
All other expenses must be approved by Corporate Overlords during a plotting
session as described in Section 5.

### Company Canoe
During the plotting session at the end of each fiscal year the Corporate Overlords
must consider a vote on the purchase of a company canoe, to be named and labeled the
"BIFS BIFFUD Canoe".  If ever approved, the Corporate Overlords must update this
agreement with a record of the achieved milestone as well as the identification of a
new capitalistic goal.

All company vehicles, ships, and other purchases must appropriately named. These names
shall be catalogued by the Keeper of Lore.

Corporate ship names shall be prefixed by "BIFS" which will stand for "Bad Idea Factory
Ship."
