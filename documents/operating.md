### BIFFUD Projects
BIFFUD exists to support the creation of projects.  These projects are
approved by the Corporate Overlords, owned and maintained by Members,
and built by Minions.

### Ownership Contracts
All owners of a project must be BIFFUD members, and the percentages and specific
terms of ownership must be coordinated by those members as part of the project's
induction into The Company in the form of an Ownership Contract.

The Ownership Contract should specify participation expectations
and ownership percentages, as well as guidelines for how potential profits
should be distributed.

Changes to project ownership over time must be communicated to The Beastmaster.

### Project Resources
Resources required to complete or support a project can come from several
different sources:

A. **Sponsored support** includes resources from grants, gifts, or other payment
from third parties.  Resources provided by a third party must be approved by the
Overmind and must be distributed as per the third party's agreement.

B. **Member Support** includes resources directly provided by BIFFUD members;
this may or may not be associated with ownership.

C. **BIFFUD Support** includes resources provided by the entire corporation.  These
resources represent expense and affect profit calculations at the end of the year.

D. **Profit Reinvestment** at the end of the fiscal year a project may be allocated
funds based on profit earned.  These funds can be distributed among owners or re-invested
into the project.


### Disputes Between Project Owners
If project owners disagree, the Beastmaster is responsible for addressing the
disagreement.  If the beastmaster fails to create harmony, the Beastmaster proposes a
solution and if either the Undermind or Overmind approve it, the Owners in conflict can
either accept that solution or mutually agree on an alternative.

### Retiring a BIFFUD Project
All BIFFUD projects, regardless of how they are resourced and supported,
must be maintained and owned by at least one member of BIFFUD.  If a project
no longer has a BIFFUD member interested in owning it or if The Hive decides that
the project should be removed from The Company, a motion can be passed to change the status
to retired.

Any profits due to be distributed to a retired project are pro rated in terms of how long
the project was active during the fiscal year.  Any remaining profits are considered corporate
profit.

The code base associated with a retired project should be kept in the BIFFUD repository.

Services that incur continuing costs to BIFFUD and are solely associated with retired
projects should be ended by members of The Hive Mind as quickly as corporately possible.

### Evaluating Ideas
Anybody can build anything they want at any time, but in order for something to become
an official BIFFUD project it must be formally adopted by the Corporate Overlords during
a plotting session.  The determination of what makes a project a BIFFUD project is
ultimately determined by that process, but in the spirit of framing the conversation,
the following questions are recommended.

1. How is this project a bad idea?
2. Where are the lulz?
3. Does it make you thinking face emoji?
4. Is it realistic to implement through BIFFUD?
5. If the project were a character in Dungeons and Dragons, what would it's alignment be?

The BIFFUD brand deserves compelling answers to questions 1 and 2. Projects should be
realistic to implement, and should be "Chaotic Good", "Neutral Good", or
"Chaotic Neutral".  All of these data points simply serve as guidance. The ultimate
decision of what projects should be adopted falls on the Corporate Overlords.

### Intellectial Property / Internet Protocol
The following numbered clauses apply to all BIFFUD projects unless explicitly approved
otherwise by the Corporate Overlords during project approval or at a later date during
a plotting session.

1. Everything contributed to a BIFFUD project must be developed in the open and licensed
under the Apache License, Version 2.0. A Project may use another license by approval of
Majority of the Corporate Overlords (for example, if another license is necessary for the
purposes of fulfilling third party funding requirements, or if a copyleft license better suits
the goals of the Project).

2. All BIFFUD projects must have the language written in `documents/contributing_addition.md`
inserted into a CONTRIBUTING.md file at the root level of the project unless explicitly
approved otherwise by the Corporate Overlords during project approval or at a later date
during a plotting session.

3. Copyright and patent rights for all potential code or other creative works with a BIFFUD
project must be granted to BIFFUD before it can be incorporated into a project, unless the
Beastmaster gives their approval.

The Hive Mind has the ability to transfer IP to or from external sources (with approval of
project owners).  These actions require a Majority vote of the Corporate Overlords.
