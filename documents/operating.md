### Capital Contributions
Corporate Overlords must contribute a $300 initial capital contribution
to BIFFUD within three months of indoctrination.

The Hive Mind can vote to increase the required capitalcontribution number,
as described in Section 5. Contribution increases are retroactive and Corporate
Overlords have 3 months to cough up the extra dough.

### Third Party contributions
Third parties can give money to BIFFUD as a non-deductable donation or grant,
and that money will be allocated according to the terms agreed upon by the
Overmind, Treasure Goblin, and the third party.  These donations do not come
with any expectation of ownership of BIFFUD.

### Organizational Resources
The Overmind may submit budget requests to The Hive Mind for resources
that will be used by BIFFUD as an organization.  For example, for licenses,
services, fonts, La Croix, or other assets that need cash money to obtain.

### Project Resources
The Hive Mind is responsible for allocating financial support to BIFFUD Projects.
The project owners must select a single person to be the project's "Comptroller" who
is responsible for approving any invoices associated with a project and working with
the Beastmaster and Treasure Goblin to receive access to centralized services or
financial reimbursement, depending on the nature of the allocation.

At the time of budget approval the Corporate Overlords must specify if
the resources are being "given" or "loaned" to the project.

Invoices that are not approved by a project's Cashier will not be compensated
unless they are explicitly approved by the Treasure Goblin.

### Distributing Profits
Profits are calculated at the end of the fiscal year ((Howard To Define)).  If by
some miracle there are profits on a given year, the following formula
will dictate its distribution:

1. A mandatory distribution of profit will be made to offset individual
taxes on that profit.  Corporate Overlords may vote to prevent this
distribution, as described in Section 5.  Whatever is left shall be called
the Spoils of War.

2. 60% of the Spoils of War will be distributed to the projects in proportion
to the project-level profit distribution.  For example, if a project earned
70% of BIFFUD's total profit, that profit would be allocated 70% of the 60% of
the Spoils of War.

2b. If a project has a profit allocation and the project had been allocated
a "loan" from BIFFUD, that project's allocated profit is reduced by BIFFUD
and subtracted from the outstanding balance.

2c. The project owners are paid in proportion to their project ownership
percentage.

3. 20% of the Spoils of War shall be distributed to the Corporate Overlords
in proportion of their pro-rated ownership percentage.  For example, if a Corporate
Overlord was only part of The Hive Mind for half of a year their pro-rated ownership
percentage would be half that of a full-term Corporate Overlord's.

4. 20% of the Spoils of War shall be added to the company coffers.

### Compensation
Any compensation paid to individuals working on a project must be associated
with a contract that has either been approved by the Treasurer and Overmind.

### Expenses
Members and Coporate Overlords may receive reimbursement for expenses associated
with a project through the processes outlined in the "Allocating Resources For
Projects" section.

One-time expenses under $100.00 may be approved by the Treasurer at any time.
All other expenses must be approved by Corporate Overlords during a plotting
session as described in Section 5.

### Company Canoe
During the plotting session at the end of each fiscal year the Corporate Overlords
must consider a vote on the purchase of a company canoe, to be named and labeled the
"BIFS BIFFUD Canoe".  If ever approved, the Corporate Overlords must update this
agreement with a record of the achieved milestone as well as the identification of a
new capitalistic goal.

All company vehicles, ships, and other purchases must appropriately named. These names
shall be catalogued by the Keeper of Lore.

Corporate ship names shall be prefixed by "BIFS" which will stand for "Bad Idea Factory
Ship."
