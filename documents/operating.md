### Capital Contributions
Each Corporate Overlord will contribute an $300 initial capital contribution
to BIFFUD within three months of achieving Corporate Overlord status.

Additional capital contributions can be voted on and approved by the
Corporate Overlords during a plotting session.

Question for Howard: how do we allow members *or* CO's to contribute
funds directly to specific BIFFUD projects without having equity impact?


### Allocating Resources to Projects
The Corporate Overlords can vote to assign budgets to BIFFUD Projects
which are then overseen by the project owners.  The project owners
must select a single person to be the project's "Cashier" who is
responsible for approving any invoices associated with a project or
working with the BIFFUD Treasurer to make purchases using BIFFUD funds.

At the time of budget approval the Corporate Overlords must specify if
the resources are being "given" or "loaned" to the project.

Invoices that are not approved by a project's Cashier will not be compensated
unless they are explicitly approved by the BIFFUD Treasurer.


### Distributing Profits
Profits are to be calculated at the end of the fiscal year.  If by
some miracle there are profits on a given year, the following formula
will dictate its distribution

1. A mandatory distribution of profit will be made to offset individual
taxes on that profit.  Corporate Overlords may choose to prevent this
distribution my making a 70% vote during a plotting session.

2. 60% of the remaining funds will be distributed to the projects
in proportion to the project-level profit distribution.

2b. If a project has a profit allocation and the project had been allocated
a "loan" from BIFFUD, that project's allocated profit is reduced by BIFFUD
and subtracted from the outstanding balance.

2c. The project owners may vote to decide to either distribute the profits
proportionally according to their percentage ownership of the project, or
to allocate the profit towards future project expenses.

3. The remaining 40% of the profits is kept by BIFFUD.

3b. 50% of the remaining BIFFUD profits is to be distributed to the Corporate
Overlords in terms of their ownership percentage.  The remaining 50% is to
be kept as corporate funds.  The Corporate Overlords may adjust this ratio
for a given year during a monthly plotting session.


### Compensation
Any compensation paid to individuals working on a project must be associated
with a contract that has either been approved by the Treasurer or by the
Corporate Overlords during a plotting session.


### Expenses
Members and Coporate Overlords may receive reimbursement for expenses associated
with a project through the processes outlined in the "Allocating Resources For
Projects" section.

Expenses under $100.00 may be approved by the Treasurer at any time or can be
approved by Corporate Overlords during a plotting session.  All other expenses
must be approved by Corporate Overlords during a plotting session.


### Company Canoe
During the plotting session at the end of each fiscal year the Corporate Overlords
must consider a vote on the purchase of a company canoe, to be named and labeled the
"BIFFUD Canoe".  If ever approved, the Corporate Overlords must update this agreement
with a record of the achieved milestone as well as the identification of a new
capitalistic goal.
