SECTION 1: üìöüìöüìö Official Operating Agreement üìöüìöüìö
---------------------------------------------------------------------
### Company Term
BIFFUD shall be dissolved as a Limited Liability Company if any of the following occur:

1. A vote to terminate the organization is passed by a Complete Consensus of Corporate Overlords.
2. The Hive Mind fails to hold a single meeting with quorum for a period of one consecutive year.
3. Everyone dies/there are no more Corporate Overlords.
4. If all Corporate Overlords identify as cis-hetero white men.

### Continuance of Company
If a Corporate Overlord leaves BIFFUD, dies, or uploads their brain to the
cloud, the ownership of the remaining Corporate Overlords will then be evenly
distributed (e.g., if four Corporate Overlords remain, each will own 1/4 of BIFFUD).

### Lawsuits Between BIFFUD Associates
All BIFFUD Associates involved in a lawsuit must play a group game of
Mario Party 3 before any arbitration happens.  BIFFUD must loan any
necessary hardware needed to make this possible.  Efforts must be made
to obtain a Nintendo 64 for this endeavor, however, if obtaining such hardware would cause unreasonable burden, emulation is acceptable so long as a legal license for Mario Party 3 is first obtained by the Company.

If more than four Associates are involved in a lawsuit, a Mario Party 3
elimination tournament must be played.  The terms of the tournament shall
be dictated by a neutral third party.

### Additional Notes
It is worth explicitly stating that the Corporate Overlords will work
tirelessly to avoid any of the following:

- Giving up on their stakeholders.
- Letting anybody down to whom they have made a commitment.
- Disappearing/"running around" for long periods of time without communicating.
- Deserting one another as members without formally abdicating their stake.

Furthermore, they will try not to:

- Make anybody cry.
- Close the company and say "goodbye", so long as there someone is out there
willing to carry the torch forward.

Changes to Section 0 or Section 1 of this Operating Agreement shall require a
Complete Consensus vote of the Hive Mind.

Changes to all other sections, or the creation of new sections, shall require
a Strong Consensus vote of the Hive Mind.

At no point will any other section of this Operating Agreement override the
terms or definitions laid out in Section 0 or 1.

SECTION 2: ü§ùü§ùü§ù Partnership ü§ùü§ùü§ù
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Types of Involvement
1. **Corporate Overlord:** Corporate Overlords maintain ownership stake in BIFFUD. They have votes during plotting sessions and can review pull
requests to `corporate`.  Corporate Overlords may also maintain ownership stake
in "**BIFFUD Projects**".

2. **Members:** Members may maintain ownership stake in "**Member Owned Projects**". Any sentient entity with ownership over a BIFFUD Project must also be a BIFFUD member unless they are Corporate Overlords.  Members are entitled to attend Plotting Sessions.

3. **Minions:** Minions are contributing participants in BIFFUD Projects. They
might contribute via code, cash, or expertise. They are entitled to attend Plotting Sessions. Minions do not retain any ownership rights unless specified in a project's Ownership Agreement.

### Adding Corporate Overlords
Although previously thought impossible, an ancient ritual found buried
in the ruins of Lawyer Cave describes the process of creating new
Corporate Overlords.

Any Corporate Overlord may nominate an Overlord Candidate ("**Candidate**") during a plotting session.  If the nomination is seconded, the ritual begins.

1. The Hive Mind is presented with a biography of the Candidate.
2. The Candidate submits a piece of original poetry or other creative
work for the Overlords' enjoyment and consideration.
3. A vote is held.

If the vote passes, as defined in Section 5, then after the Plotting Session
ends the new Corporate Overlord is on-boarded and ownership of the company is
redistributed so that each overlord owns an equal share.

### Removing Corporate Overlords
A Corporate Overlord can recuse itself from BIFFUD at any time by dying, uploading
its consciousness to the cloud, or submitting a letter of resignation to the
Overmind of BIFFUD, the Governor of Pennsylvania, and the President of the
United States.

Corporate Overlords may also vote to remove a peer from the organization if
any of the following conditions apply:

- The Corporate Overlord fails to attend 50% of the monthly plotting sessions
in the current or previous fiscal year without a note from a family member explaining its absence.
- The Corporate Overlord has violated a serious federal law in the current or previous fiscal year.
- The Corporate Overlord is hated or despised.
- The Corporate Overlord fails to pay a required capital contribution within
three months of notification.

The removal of a corporate overlord can be nominated during a plotting session
and the vote must pass as defined in Section 5.

### Hibernating Corporate Overlords
A Corporate Overlord can go into hibernation.  Hibernation does not remove their
ownership of BIFFUD or their entitlement to profit share, but their role as a voting
member of the Hive is temporarily revoked until they attend a plotting session.
Quorum and voting calculations do not include Corporate Overlords in hibernation.

There are two ways for Corporate Overlords to enter hibernation:

1. If a Corporate Overlord fails to attend four scheduled plotting sessions in a row,
regardless of whether or not Quorum was met, they are automatically considered to be
hibernating.

2. If a Corporate Overlord provides written communication to the Overmind that they
wish to be placed into hibernation.

A Corporate Overlord exits hibernation immediately by attending a plotting session.

### Adding Members
Anybody with ownership over a BIFFUD Project is considered a BIFFUD Member.  Members
must sign the Membership Contract found in `/documents/member_agreement.md`.

### Removing Members
Members may be removed from the organization by the Beastmaster when they are no longer associated with any
BIFFUD projects.

### Adding Minions
Anybody with an accepted Pull Request in a BIFFUD project is automatically considered
a Minion.  Before a Pull Request can be approved, the contributor must submit a signed
Contributor License Agreement found in `/documents/minion_agreement.md`.


### Removing Minions
Minions lose their status automatically one year after their most recent contribution to a BIFFUD project.


### Corporate Overlord Responsibilities
Bad Idea Factory is a Limited Liability Corporation, which means that
partnership can't _just_ be about the spirit or the lulz -- partners
have legal responsibilities, ownership, and control over the Company
direction.

Corporate Overlords are expected to:

1. Make a capital contribution upon joining.
2. Participate and vote in monthly plotting sessions.
3. Participate in reviews for changes to corporate GitHub.
4. Contribute original poetry on corporate GitHub.
5. Stay involved and aware of the projects being undertaken by members.
6. Help maintain and further the BIFFUD public footprint.
7. Try to attend BIFFUD events.
8. Adhere to the guidelines laid out in this document, particularly the
spirit depicted in Section 1.

### Member Responsibilities
Members hold no responsibilities at the corporate level of BIFFUD.  They
may have responsibilities outlined in their project-level agreements.

### Minion Responsibilities
Minions hold no responsibilities at the corporate level of BIFFUD.

### Elected Roles
In addition to base expectations, the following positions are to be held
by Corporate Overlords.  Details of the election process are provided in Section 5.

- **Overmind (President):** Has a gavel.  The Overmind is responsible for
running Plotting Sessions and signing contracts with third parties.

- **Undermind (Vice President):** Has a smaller gavel.  The Undermind
is responsible for laughing whenever the Overmind makes a joke, fulfilling
out the Overmind's duties if the Overmind goes into hibernation, and
Undermin(d)ing the Overmind(ing).

- **Treasure Goblin (Treasurer):** Keeps track of money, works with accountants, oversees
and approves small expenses.

- **Keeper of Lore (Secretary):** Ensures notes and minutes are taken for Plotting Sessions,
ensures that proper CONTRIBUTING.md protocols are followed in `corporate`.

- **Secretary of Code:** Ensures that corporate defined commit protocols are
followed in all BIFFUD projects, as well as `corporate`.

- **Beastmaster:** Makes certain decisions related to BIFFUD projects and
ensures that the Corporate Overlords are aware of the progress and activity
of BIFFUD projects.

- **The Popular One:** Handles public communication.  Runs BIFFUD social media accounts with input from other interested Corporate Overlords.

Detailed responsibilities of each role are explained in the corresponding
`roles/*.md` file.  One person is allowed to fill more than one role, but
the Overmind and Undermind must be separate people.

If nobody is willing to take on a role, Corporate Overlords are encouraged to
send regular announcements to the Hive Mind through the loudest and most obnoxious
mechanism at their disposal until the role is filled.

If an elected member goes into hibernation or decides to step down, a Fire Sale Election is to be held as described in Section 5.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3: ü§îü§îü§î Projects ü§îü§îü§î
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### BIFFUD Projects
BIFFUD exists to support the creation of projects.  These projects are
approved by the Corporate Overlords, owned and maintained by Members,
and built by Minions.

### Ownership Contracts
All "**Owners**"" of a project must be Members, and the percentages and specific
terms of ownership must be coordinated by the Owners as part of the project's
induction into the Company in the form of an Ownership Contract.

The Ownership Contract must specify participation expectations
and ownership percentages, as well as guidelines for how potential profits
should be distributed.

Changes to project ownership must be communicated to The Beastmaster.

### Project Resources
Resources required to complete or support a project can come from several
different sources:

1. **Sponsored Support.** Includes resources from grants, gifts, or other payment
from third parties.  Resources provided by a third party must be approved by the
Overmind and must be distributed as per the third party's agreement.

2. **Member Support.** Includes resources directly provided by BIFFUD members;
this may or may not be associated with ownership.

3. **BIFFUD Support.** Includes resources provided by the entire corporation.  These
resources represent expense and affect profit calculations at the end of the year.

4. **Profit Reinvestment.** At the end of the fiscal year a project may be allocated
funds based on profit earned.  These funds can be distributed among owners or re-invested
into the project.

### Disputes Between Project Owners
If project owners disagree, the Beastmaster will attempt to address the
disagreement.  If the Beastmaster fails to create harmony, the Beastmaster proposes a
solution and if either the Undermind or Overmind approve it, the Owners in conflict must
either accept that solution or mutually agree on an alternative.

### Retiring a BIFFUD Project
All BIFFUD projects, regardless of how they are resourced and supported,
must be maintained and owned by at least one Member.  If a project
no longer has a Member interested in owning it or if The Hive decides that
the project should be removed from The Company, a motion may be passed to change the status
to retired.

Any profits due to be distributed to a retired project are prorated in terms of how long
the project was active during the fiscal year.  Any remaining profits are considered corporate
profit.

The code base associated with a retired project should be kept in the BIFFUD repository.

Services that incur continuing costs to BIFFUD and are solely associated with retired
projects should be ended by members of The Hive Mind as quickly as corporately possible.

### Evaluating Ideas
Anybody can build anything they want at any time, but in order for something to become
an official BIFFUD project it must be formally adopted by the Corporate Overlords during
a Plotting Session.  The determination of what makes a project a BIFFUD project is
ultimately determined by that process, but in the spirit of framing the conversation,
the following questions are recommended.

1. How is this project a bad idea?
2. Where are the lulz?
3. Does it make you thinking face emoji?
4. Is it realistic to implement through BIFFUD?
5. If the project were a character in Dungeons and Dragons, what would its alignment be?

The BIFFUD brand deserves compelling answers to questions one through three. Projects should be
realistic to implement, and should be "Chaotic Good", "Neutral Good", or
"Chaotic Neutral".  All of these data points simply serve as guidance. The ultimate
decision of what projects should be adopted falls on the Corporate Overlords.

### Intellectual Property/Internet Protocol
The following numbered clauses apply to all BIFFUD projects unless explicitly approved
otherwise by the Corporate Overlords during project approval or at a later date during
a Plotting Session.

1. Everything contributed to a BIFFUD project must be developed in the open and licensed
under the Apache License, Version 2.0. A Project may use another license by approval of
Majority of the Corporate Overlords (for example, if another license is necessary for the
purposes of fulfilling third party funding requirements, or if a copyleft license better suits
the goals of the Project).

2. All BIFFUD projects must have the language written in `documents/federated_contributing.md`
inserted into a CONTRIBUTING.md file at the root level of the project unless explicitly
approved otherwise by the Corporate Overlords during project approval or at a later date
during a Plotting Session.

3. Copyright and patent rights for all potential code or other creative works with a BIFFUD
project must be granted to BIFFUD before it can be incorporated into a project, unless the
Beastmaster gives their approval.

The Hive Mind has the ability to transfer Intellectual Property between BIFFUD and any external source (with approval of
project owners) through approval of the Overmind, Undermind, and Beastmaster.  The Keeper of Lore is responsible for ensuring that documentation regarding the transfer is appropriately cataloged in `corporate`

- [x] Company canoe


### Capital Contributions
Corporate Overlords must contribute a $300 initial capital contribution
to BIFFUD within three months of indoctrination.

The Hive Mind can vote to increase the required capital contribution number,
as described in Section 5. Contribution increases are retroactive and Corporate
Overlords have three months to cough up the extra dough.

Failure to contribute in a timely manner will result in revocation of Corporate Overlord status.

### Third Party Contributions
Third parties can give money to BIFFUD as a non-deductible donation or grant.
Money donated in this way will be allocated according to the terms agreed upon by the
Overmind, Treasure Goblin, and the third party.  Donations do not come
with any expectation of ownership of BIFFUD.

### Organizational Resources
The Overmind may submit budget requests to the Hive Mind for resources
that will be used by BIFFUD as an organization.  For example, for licenses,
services, fonts, La Croix, or other assets that require cash money.

### Project Resources
The Hive Mind is responsible for allocating financial support to Projects.
Project owners must select a single person to be the project's "Comptroller" who
is responsible for approving any invoices associated with a project and working with
the Beastmaster and Treasure Goblin to receive access to centralized services or
financial reimbursement, depending on the nature of the allocation.

Invoices that are not approved by a project's Comptroller will not be compensated
unless they are explicitly approved by the Treasure Goblin.

### Distributing Profits
Profits are calculated at the end of the fiscal year (December 31st).  If by
some miracle there are profits on a given year, the following formula
will dictate their distribution:

1. A mandatory distribution of profit will be made to offset individual
taxes on that profit.  Corporate Overlords may vote to prevent this
distribution, as described in Section 5.  Whatever is left shall be called
the Spoils of War.

2. 60% of the Spoils of War will be distributed to the projects in proportion
to the project-level profit contribution.  For example, if a project earned
70% of BIFFUD's total profit, that Project would be allocated 70% of the 60% of
the Spoils of War.

If a project has a profit allocation and the project had been allocated
a "loan" from BIFFUD, that project's allocated profit is subtracted from the outstanding balance.

The project owners are paid in proportion to their project ownership
percentage.

3. 20% of the Spoils of War shall be distributed to the Corporate Overlords
in proportion of their prorated ownership percentage.  For example, if a Corporate
Overlord is only part of the Hive Mind for half of one year, then their prorated ownership
percentage would be half that of a full-term Corporate Overlord's ownership percentage.

4. 20% of the Spoils of War shall be added to the company coffers.

### Compensation
Any compensation paid to individuals working on a project must be associated
with a contract that has either been approved by both the Treasure Goblin and the Overmind.

### Expenses
Members and Corporate Overlords may receive reimbursement for expenses associated
with a project through the processes outlined somewhere in this document (you find it).

One-time expenses under $100.00 may be approved by the Treasure Goblin at any time.
All other expenses must be approved by Corporate Overlords during a Plotting
Session as described in Section 5.

### Company Canoe
During the final Plotting Session of each fiscal year the Corporate Overlords
must consider a vote on the purchase of a Company canoe, to be named and labeled the
"BIFS BIFFUD Canoe".  If ever approved, the Corporate Overlords must update this
agreement with a record of the achieved milestone as well as the identification of a
new capitalistic goal and a new name.

All Company vehicles, ships, and other purchases must appropriately named. These names
shall be cataloged by the Keeper of Lore.

Corporate ship names shall be prefixed by "BIFS" which will stand for "Bad Idea Factory
Ship."

SECTION 5: üó£üó£üó£ Governing Process üó£üó£üó£
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Schedules and Expectations
All meaningful organizational decisions will happen in monthly Plotting
Sessions, which are to be scheduled and announced and publicly documented by the Keeper of Lore on April 1st of every year.  The schedule can be updated as needed, but a notice of 10 days must be given before any Plotting Session can be held.

Notices of meetings are to be communicated via email notification and
published on GitHub `corporate` in CALENDAR.md

April 1st marks the beginning of the Governing Year, and all positions are considered open until re-filled.  During this time, previously elected officials maintain their positions temporarily.  An Election must be held during a Plotting Session in the month of April.  If an Election is not held in April then a Period of Anarchy occurs.

### Period of Anarchy
During a "**Period of Anarchy**", any Corporate Overlord able to gather enough of the Hive Mind in order to achieve quorum may chair a Fire Sale Election for any open role.  April 1st of every year is always considered a Period of Anarchy.

### April 1st
Votes cast during Plotting Sessions by Corporate Overlords on April 1st of every year are not real and motions can not actually be passed.  Votes and motions must still be recorded by the Keeper of Lore.

### Deliberation Processes
#### Plotting Session
Plotting Sessions are agenda driven and require a Quorum.  They
are led by the chair (as determined by the Chain of Command).

The Hive Mind will use Robert's Rules of Order to run Plotting Sessions
in an orderly and Robertly fashion.

When possible, video should be enabled for any plotting session.  Votes should be
cast using physical emoji üëç, üëé, and üòê (or any skin tone variation) depicted
on signs attached to sticks and held up to indicate votes of yes, no, and abstain
respectively.  Members can also vote by raising their hands, or by voice, but this will be considered lame.

"Yar" and "Nar" are considered valid alternatives to "Aye" and "Nay" during voice votes.

A role call vote can take place instead if the Keeper of Lore or the meeting
chair deems it necessary in order to properly tally a vote.

#### GitHub
Decisions made on GitHub are either interim decisions that must
culminate in a Plotting Session to finalize, or they are decisions
related to BIFFUD's GitHub process and documentation policy.

1. The person requesting a vote should review the instructions set
forth in `CONTRIBUTING.md` based on the type of vote being requested.

2. A Pull Request must be made against the `master` branch of the
BIFFUD corporate repository.

3. The Secretary of Code reviews the Pull Request and requests any changes
related to standards violations or mistakes.

4. Once the Pull Request is deemed valid, the Secretary of Code requests
a review from the relevant role.

5. Corporate Overlords may weigh in using comments.

6. Requests that require a Plotting Session are left open until a final
vote is taken during a plotting session.  If a vote during a plotting session is associated with a Pull Request, The Keeper of Lore updates
the Pull Request with a record of the vote outcome.

7. Requests that do not require a Plotting Session are left open until
they pass or fail.  Requests that do not require a Plotting Session
automatically fail if they have been open for over a month.

If a vote is considered preliminary, although actions may be triggered
by initial indications of passage, the vote is not final until after a
Plotting Session has been held.

If a vote is final and passes, the Pull Request is merged by the Keeper
of Code and the branch is deleted.

If a vote is final and fails, the Pull Request is closed without merge
by the Secretary of Code and the branch is deleted.


### Voting Decisions
The following decisions will require a formal input from the Hive Mind.

The GitHub processes for each decision are outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md
and those processes should be followed.

- **Adding projects (Preliminary):** GitHub (needs Apathetic Support).
This type of request is made by anybody who wants to submit their
project or idea to BIFFUD for approval to become an official BIFFUD
project. Upon preliminary approval the code base is incorporated into
the BIFFUD repository and the Beastmaster provides the project owners
with a biffud.com subdomain.

- **Adding projects:** Plotting Session (needs Strong Consensus). If
the vote passes, the steps outlined in the preliminary vote description
are invoked.  The listed owners of the project are made Members and onboarded by the Beastmaster.  The project budget is given
to the Treasure Goblin for categorization.  The Beastmaster also now
has permission to give access to any approved resources as required by
the project.

- **Updating projects (Preliminary):** GitHub (needs Apathetic Support).
This type of request is made by Owners of a project who
want to update their project's application file after it has been
approved.

- **Updating projects:** GitHub (with no money changes; needs Beastmaster
Approval) or Plotting Session (needs Strong Consensus).  Any change
that will require additional BIFFUD resources cannot be approved by the
Beastmaster; it requires Strong Consensus during a Plotting Session.

- **Removing projects:** Plotting Session (needs Strong Consensus).
If a project has been voted for removal from BIFFUD, the project must
be removed from BIFFUD servers and team repository.  The transfer plan
and timeline should be specified as part of the vote.  If it is not,
the timeline is one month and the intent is to transfer related code and
data to project owners.

- **Adding Corporate Overlords:** Plotting Session (needs Strong
Consensus).

- **Removing Corporate Overlords:** Plotting Session (needs Strong
Consensus).

- **Changing section 0 or 1 of `operating.md`:** Plotting Session (needs
Complete Consensus). Note: this is as specified in Section 1 and repeated
here for convenience.

- **Changing other sections of `operating.md`:** Plotting Session (needs
Strong Consensus).

- **Approving expenses (Preliminary):** GitHub (needs Majority).
Preliminary approval of expenses above $100 will allow the Treasure
Goblin to release preliminarily approved funds at their discretion
within the bounds of the approved expense timeline.  Note: the Treasure Goblin cannot approve their own expenses.

- **Approving expenses:** Plotting Session (needs Strong Consensus).
Upon approval the Treasure Goblin must release approved funds within
the bounds of the approved expense timeline or the approval is voided.

- **Canceling tax reimbursement:** Plotting Session (needs Strong
Consensus).  This vote indicates that the tax reimbursement to
Corporate Overlords for company profits will not be distributed
for the current fiscal year.

- **Soliciting one-time capital contributions:** Plotting Session
(needs Complete Consensus).  This vote indicates that the Corporate
Overlords will be required to make an additional capital contribution
in order to remain Corporate Overlords.

- **Creating one-time capital disbursement:** Plotting Session (needs
Strong Consensus).  This vote indicates that BIFFUD will disburse capital
to Corporate Overlords in proportion to their ownership levels.

- **Making modifications to `CONTRIBUTING.md`:** GitHub (needs Apathetic
Support).  This vote approves changes to the processes associated with
the votes as described in CONTRIBUTING.md

- **Making other modifications to `corporate`:** GitHub (needs
Apathetic Support).  This vote approves changes to the structure or
organization of the corporate GitHub repository.

- **Approving minutes:** GitHub (needs Apathetic Support).  Minutes are
submitted by the Keeper of Lore using the processes and standards defined in
CONTRIBUTING.md.

- **Approving minutes:** GitHub (needs Apathetic Support).  Minutes are
submitted by the Keeper of Lore using the processes and standards defined in
CONTRIBUTING.md.

Here's a summary table:

### Elections
Elected terms end on April 1st and Elections for those seats are held during the Plotting Session held in March. Candidates must submit their application for a position 24 hours before the Plotting Session is scheduled to begin, using the process outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md.

Votes will be held using the Condorcet voting method.  In the event of
a tie, then the tied candidates must choose champions.  The candidate whose champion can score highest in QWOP wins. If this also results in a tie then candidates must collect votes from people on the Internet for 24 hours, on any desired platform. The candidate with the most votes wins. In the event of another tie, pray that attrition causes a candidate to drop out.

If there is only one candidate for a given position the election requires a Majority vote.

If a Majority of Corporate Overlords abstain from voting for a particular position, the election results don't count.

### Fire Sale Elections
In the event that a Corporate Overlord holding an elected position goes into hibernation or chooses to step down from their elected position, or if any position is unfilled for any reason, then a Fire Sale Election is to be held to fill the vacant position.  Fire Sale Elections can happen during any Plotting Session and the voting process is the same as with regular Elections except that people are probably more excited.

### Records and Documentation
The `corporate` GitHub repository is our official record.  Minutes should be taken during
Plotting Sessions, and it is the responsibility of the Keeper of Lore or a
temporary appointee to take notes that reflect attendance, decisions, meaningful
discussion, and vote counts.

The contents of the `corporate` GitHub make up the Company records.
Documentation structure and organization should be performed as outlined
in CONTRIBUTING.md.  The Secretary of Code is responsible for ensuring
that the Keeper of Lore is adhering to the guidelines laid out in
CONTRIBUTING.md.
